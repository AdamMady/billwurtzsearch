    "html": "<h3> <dco>1.18.18&nbsp;\n8:14 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Hey bill. I am kind of a dreamer and I don't quite understand how I developed the mindset I did, being surrounded by so many people who think differently than me, but I'm really happy I did. I just believe more that everybody's special and should do what they want to do in life, regardless of their status and that they have the power to achieve that. But each time I bring this up, my whole family tries so hard to bash into my head that this is the wrong way to approach the world and it really upsets me because I believe that my approach to the world is how one can achieve creation and innovation. Like if we had accepted how things were and never strive to change, us as a human race wouldn't be where we are now. And it saddens me when people around me try soooo hard to force me to think like what they do- don't stand out and accept things the way they are and so much bullshit in my opinion. I look up to a lot of people that inspire me, like you, and s\n o many o\n thers, and all the great things that surround me in my life that give me hope that I could push foreword and prove everybody around me wrong. That I can live the life I want, and that I could potentially make it and be like you or my other inspirations and bring more great things to the rest of the world. It's my main motivation in my life at the moment. But it's really hard with so many people surrounding me like this- telling me I shouldn't think this way. I don't agree with settling any less and living someone else's life and wasting what makes me unique and great. It's just difficult to find the time to put my energy into what I want to do with the many responsibilities I have already and With all of these people trying so hard to change me. I know my situation may not seem that bad, but It's kinda driving me crazy. Stressing me out. Sometimes my hope dwindles because of this. I want to breakthrough and prove all of these people wrong, but it's always inevitable that my\n energy a\n lways crashes and my hope fades and I fall apart. My question is how do you push through when it seems that the world around you is so against you? What advice do you think would help me Persist?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"

I just use the standard recording program that just came with my computer (audacity).. i dont do anything with effects any editing apart from just adjusting the volumes of each track. I love writing and recording music, but the sound quality is always crap. Doesn't really bother me now. But again, I feel like at some point I'm going to have to climb that mountain of learning that side of making music.
