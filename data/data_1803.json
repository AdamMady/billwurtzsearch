I had this great idea: \"Hey, I'm going to turn that short story of mine into a stage play\" So, I start writing. And ew. In my head the idea worked so well, but on paper it's just not good. It loses all the stuff that made the original so fucking good. It made me kinda resent the story and avoid working on the script but the deadline is rearing it's godawful head and I'm going to have to finish it even though i don't like it and it just isn't what I wish it was.
