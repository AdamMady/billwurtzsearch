Do you try to focus on non-melody parts like the bass and inner harmonies as a challenge? Do you visualize the melodies as notes of a piano roll? Do you try to imagine movie scenes that could go along with the music? Do you make yourself feel as if what you are about to hear is heavenly, so that you are positively predisposed? Do you channel your inner Leonard Bernstein and air-conduct an imaginary symphony orchestra in your bedroom? Basically the question is, how to hang from the first note and keep flying till the last note (paraphrasing Daniel Barenboim here), so that I can thorougly enjoy a piece of music and make my brain shut up and listen?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
