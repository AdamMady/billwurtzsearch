It's likely that that line \"world goes round and then comes back down\" seems to represent the feeling of cycling through these song sections in this way.<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i'll assume this line's meant to lead musically into the instrumental verse\n<br>\n<br>[instrumental verse]\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\"now i'm swingin about my every daily business\n<br>and i'm pondering out about how it's daily been\"\n<br>alright alright\n<br>\n<br>\"and it's easy to feel if you're useless\n<br>but it's strange wh\n en you tell your friends\"\n<br>yeah. it's hard to sincerely admit your flaws without veiling it behind irony\n</qco></h3>      i changed my mind: this is the worst part of the song. i wish i could have done better. the goal-post here should be to make this have the same sort of high-flying 'sail' that the first bridge had (124th street). unfortunately i was unable to live up to this<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"so i re-loaded my fax machine with some fresh clean paper\n<br>so i can slow down and have a slow time printing it out\"\n<br>fax machine is sort of odd, so that's why it's here. i don't understand what the verse MEANS, but i'm liking it texturally and rhythmically. \n</qco></h3>      right. i think after the previous bridge seemed to get us into a bland rut, i think i was reaching toward something more playful<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slowing down printing out faxes is revisiting the slowing down for being late to hell idea, i.e. it isn't something you really want to do, but it's something YOU would want to do.\n<br>\n<br>\"then the roof blew off again and it came back down\"\n<br>parallel lyrically to the previous verse. could you talk about these two lines a little? thanks\n</qco></h3>      yes, i definitely think it reflects the sensation of cycling through these A and B sections of the song. over, and over, and over, and over again.<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"and hurricaines and storms cover the landscape\n<br>and the picture frames are floating off the wall\n<br>and the hourglass is twisting a little bit sideways\n<br>and the neighbourhood is all gone\"\n<br>first: beautiful vocals\n<br>second: this is\n  the apocalyptic nature of your works REALLY standing out-- you're bulletproof in life, truly\n<br>third: the hourglass is twisting sideways, meaning time is SLOWING DOWN, which means everything will be alright?\n</qco></h3>      i was lucky i was able to barely squeak by with something mildly original in this section. everyone can see we're dangerously close to being in a serious rut of just cycling over the form like a zombie<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"look at the time, on the wall\n<br>cuz it's going very very really slowly now\"\n</qco></h3>      this part is the breakthrough, because as you can see i've finally freed myself from the prison of the never-ending sort of AABA paradigm the rest of the song has been in<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beautiful beautiful beautiful, this entire verse, and i love how the lead in to it feels like we've been 'submerged' musically somehow. great. time is going slowly now because of the 'apocalypse?'\n</qco></h3>      it's going slowly now (in a nice way) because i've finally broken out of that damn form, from before. and it just feels really good. new melodies, new content, new chords, it's like when you spend 80% of the party in 1 room and you've gotten bored of it and then you move into a new room that you never saw for the other 80% of the time<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"and it's the only thing that anybody ever talks about\n<br>and the scientists are always trying to figure out\n<br>and the physicists are always letting it bounce around\"\n<br>i'll talk about these three lines at the end of the verse.\n</qco></h3>      it looks like i'm so glad to be in this section, i just wanna let it go around forever<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; including an instrumental line in this entire twelve-line verse is a great choice musically, even though i don't know anything about music. this balances out the verse. freshens it up. makes people go 'ooh. let's\n  see what's going on.' \n<br>i'm not a musician but does it mean something that the instrumental line is the sixth line? </qco></h3>      it seems to be on the 5th line. which is after 4 lines. in this case, the 4 lines feels like a complete unit. but the truth is, i really wanna just keep these going and stay in this section. but there's a chance that maybe i shouldn't stay any longer ...... so i guess i throw it to a musical riff because obviously i still have that melody in my head, and then the fact that we leave after 1 shows that even though we briefly considered leaving, what we really want to do is double down and stay<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like does it have anything to do with those timing things the uh TIME SIGNATURE? because like i think a waltz goes:\n<br>du DU DU \n<br>du DU DU\n<br>du DU DU\n<br>which is a regular rhythm or something\n<br>and what you've done with your verse here is go:\n<br>1\n<br>2\n<br>3,\n<br>1\n<br>2\n<br>[IRREGULARITY].\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\"and the novelists are typically writing stories about it\n<br>and the journalists are usually breaking news about it\n<br>and the pharmacists are frequently making drugs about it\n<br>and the charities are always raising money for it\"\n<br>i think this entire verse is trying to evoke that 'diagonal' quality to it. great great great.\n<br>\n<br>\"and the client's name is always there \n<br>and [client's name] always cares\"\n<br>beautiful end to the song. somehow you've gotten 'back home' musically not by returning to the same place but by..\n . creating a new home?!?!?</qco></h3>      i suppose in a way, perhaps i had 'paid my dues' through the rest of the song because i had basically been feeling slightly uncomfortable/skeptical about just keeping the AABA form for so long. it felt good the first time around, but after that, there was always this skepticism about just drilling around the form like that. Was decidedly the best option at the time, but still gave me this nagging feeling of unfulfillment throughout. So it really felt refreshing to hit that outtro (everything after \"very slowly now\", up to the end), and that rush was enough to keep me out of the worry zone, all the way until the end <h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</qco> </h3>      \n\n\n<br><br>"
