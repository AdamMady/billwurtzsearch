I know you're likely going to answer this with some sort of \"holy fishpaste the magnitude of friendliness is overwhelming\" and that's great I really like those answers and how they're always different but I hope you do read this and understand the sincerity of my thanks. I have always felt like there was this slight pretentiousness living inside me about the music that I like. Like if it didn't have extended harmony or weird changes or complicated rhythms it was stupid, but only SOMEWHAT. And I never really liked this about myself but it always felt true and I had a hard time liking other, lets just say more popular sounding music. But listening to your music has made a huge change within me. Like I would never have been into a song like New Canaan even a year ago but now here I am hearing the music and enjoying it and experiencing it like how music should be experienced! And I just feel so much more open to the worl\n d when i\n t comes to writing my songs and all the opportunities that are out there. I think I'm really just enjoying music the most I ever have right now, and I owe it all to you. It definitely has an impact on how I view the world as well. Everything seems better. So thank you Bill!!!</qco> </h3>"
