I normally have a kinda easy time creating the chords on the piano and then writing the lyrics, but what I have a problem with is adding more instruments/effects. I've tried using GarageBand before, but nothing else ever seems to go with my music, and I'm not sure if I'm just not good at music production (I kinda failed that class at school) or if my songs just shouldn't have any instruments besides piano, but my songs tend to get really boring after a while with no instruments. I've probably said a bit more than needed, but I was wondering... can you give me some tips on adding more effects and instruments to songs?</qco> </h3>      \ni have an idea....... start with the shortest song you can imagine. start with a song that's only 1 second long, with only 1 word in it. you'll have plenty of time to try out everything imaginable, because it will barely take any time to try each thing. once you find some things that work, expand those techniques into a 2 word song. and so on\n<br><br>"
