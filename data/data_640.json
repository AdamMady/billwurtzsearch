I'm kind of stuck in this state of mind where I'm thinking I can't \"just write a melody\" but instead, I have to do it in a certain way. I see the way Elton John and Billy Joel and Freddie Mercury seem to just sit down and try something a few times and it's good, </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they are all obviously very knowledgeable in music. I know it's not true, but I'm having trouble breaking away from this idea that I need to know more before I even try to write a good melody. Anyways, do you have any advice on how to stop trying to mould my writing procedure on somebody else's? Thanks so much bill</qco> </h3>"
