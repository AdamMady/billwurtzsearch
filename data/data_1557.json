Take the song 'happy birthday to you' in the key of C. right before the end of the song, on the last \"birth\". the harmony is probably playing C chord, but i think you'll find that the best place for the bass, at this point in the song, is G. i can name a trillion other examples of popular/classic/traditional songs, over the course of the last 300 years, that have had a 1(chord) over 5(bass) absolutely thrive in this right before the end finalistic 'the song's about to end' spot. you've heard it a million times. try putting C over C there instead .... it doesn't quite fit. it sounds like the beginning of the song, .... right before the end ? ... By the way, to complete the example just you you can hear it clearly, the 'good' way to do it, from the final line \"birth\" is C/G, \"day\" is D7, \"to\" is G7sus4, and \"you\" is C, preferably with the G note left out, just e c , with low C in the bass. and Fmin/Ab was on \"hap\"\n<br><br>"
