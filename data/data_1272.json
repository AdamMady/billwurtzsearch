And how did \"stuck in a rut\" come about anyways? Given it's from all the way back in 2008 I'm curious the events surrounding it.&nbsp;</qco> </h3>      hm .... it seems like most of your information is wrong. 'stuck in a rut' the audio recording was made in 2005. it definitely wasn't put on itunes until at least 2015, because i didn't have the abilitiy to put things on itunes until then. but i hopefully dated it correctly, based on when it was made (2005). as of 2005 and the many years before that, i was fully capable of writing and recording instrumental music, but the whole 'words' part of it was really not figured out yet. 'i'm stuck in a rut' was essentially all i could fathom at that time. although meanwhile i was going absolutely bonkers via text editors. which i recommend to anyone who is trying to figure out which way is which. my strategy in general was to see if i could deconstruct the entire universe and how it works. that was just the only way i could get my head around the full game of songwriting, including any and all musical/linguistical things i thought i could and might be capable of. somewhere around 2009 i think i found myself ready to get into the full songwriting game, but it still took a few more years after that to get the recording schemes, and the writing schemes, further organized. videos, is yet an entirely separate piece of the puzzle which i had to sort of put together from scratch .... which i am actually doing again now, as it turns out\n<br><br>"
