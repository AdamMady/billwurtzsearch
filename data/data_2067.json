How would you write that out (by hand)?</qco> </h3>      i can think of 3 ways, none of which are that great. make like 4 parallel universes, and put everybody's notes and rests in, as if there are 4 players sort of borrowing the same staff. if you want to convince a music program to do that, try making different 'voices'? it's a hassle, that's why handwriting is always easier. the next choice would be to tie everything over, and it would look like bigger and bigger stacks. this would be accurate but kind of a mess to read at first glance because it looks like stacked chords. and of course the other way is to just write 4 quarter notes going up and then write something on the top like \"sustain\" or \"please don't let go\" or something\n<br><br>"
