Okay anyway here i go wish me luck<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"i walk over the earth in special sandals<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i took those sandals off<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now i can fly around\"<br>'Special sandals' may represent something holding you down.. It's description as \"special\" may be found in a less positive light than tonally suggested, or perhaps could be found rather as just a catchy verbally-'adjacent adjective' ..or perhaps entirely as just a magical item betrothed upon our main character that upon removal awakens their inner super-power of flight- I'm not entirely sure and I'd love to hear your thoughts on the line.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"some people wonder why the sun is not very bright\"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my arms ar\n e much too tired for this conversation\"<br>I'll come back to this line momentarily!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"i travel the distance<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in between where i was and where i would like to be a little later\"<br>I suppose this is a long poetic way of saying I went from here to there (presumably whilst flying, of course)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"the sky is falling\"<br>Okay this gets interesting- </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in your video \"gonna clean my room\" the song goes that you'll clean your room after the 'sun burns out' and the 'sky falls down' so there's an interesting connection, added on top of that 'sun is not very bright' coincided with 'sun burns out.' </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another cool thing- 'sun burns out and the sky falls down' is also pretty similar to the line from 'mount saint helens' - 'sun falls down and the sky burns out.' I suppose in general a lot of your music conveys apocalyptic emotions and references so perhaps 'sun is not ver\n y bright' and 'the sky is falling' were merely intuition ..but then I thought deeper.. the song as a whole... And I realized given all the present themes of the future being upon us and reconciling that with the memories of our past, maybe all this really does take place farther along upon a vast timeline, where the sun may really be slowly dying out and no longer radiates light to the extent of our own. And all this talk of the sun and skies still connects it all back to 'flying around'. His arms are supposedly too tired to talk about it, maybe from flying, or maybe even because he doesn't want to talk about it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"the sky is larger <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than any sky can be\"<br>This builds on 'sky is falling\" describing how unimaginably and unbelievably vast the sky truly is, presumably as seen from the perspective of one flying across it.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"oo, ah, oh, ee<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my calendar is telling me it's the future\"<br>I remember you talking about this sorta lyrical device in an answer to a question about balancing phrases and musical non-words, and this truly masters that- the punch and impact in this chorus is really felt.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"somewhere there's a second scene<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with characters that never speak<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you still know exactly what they mean<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you still know exactly what the story will be\" <br>This 'second scene' musically illustrates a depiction of characters who despite never exchanging any dialogue you still know what they are saying, the way a drawing conveys a story without any words.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"i travel the world without my blanket<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so when i'm feeling tired<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i can just... fly around\"<br>This is very tongue-in-cheek contradictory all around yet elicits such powerful feelings and is honestly really musically beautiful.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"most people wonder if the moon is part of the sky<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or if it's just a decoration added later\"<br>This line retains the themes of out-of-our-world observations of the sun and skies from the previous verses upon titularly flying around. It also retains a merit of scientific accuracy given as you've said in your own words: ''holy sh*t we just got hit with another ball of flaming rocks- and it kind of made a mess. which is&nbsp;🎶now the moon🎶.' In essence this line maybe asks the question 'is the moon really real?' And while being musically a melodic 'echo' of 'sun is not very bright'</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the question simultaneously implies the same feeling the statement 'the sky is larger than any sky ca\n n be' does.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"oo, ah, oh, ee<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my galaxy is spinning toward the future\"<br>Continuing to tie in visualizations of beyond-our-world intergalactic wonders, this line ties in both time and space. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"somewhere in the 7th scene<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when no one understands the point of view<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you now find so familiar\"<br>'7th scene' captures the feeling that we've moved on a little bit further into this story's future</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and also makes for a zesty rhyme with '2nd scene.' But really this line truly speaks for itself- it finds this whole analysis to be ironic. We can't fully understand the point of view that the artist finds so familiar. But that's the beauty of storytelling and songwriting. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"oh<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my memori\n es are coming back in ways i wasn't ready for<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but i'm still enjoying the way it feels\"<br>This line hits right in the feels.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also the 'oh' later transforms into 'oooh' later in the song- I just noticed that.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"so i'm holding onto the details<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capture this moment<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a series of carefully chosen words and phrases<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then replay it\"<br>This is an interesting sorta meta realization and description of songwriting, the literal feeling of capturing a feeling.. or a memory ..or a memory being made there and then.&nbsp;&nbsp;</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"walk over the earth in special sandals<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i kick those sandals off<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and watch them fly around\"<br>Flipp\n ing and twisting the opening line around and in on itself to expand upon it in a new perspective in a new verse. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"i didn't notice<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if they ever landed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but if they do i'll understand the reason\"<br>Of course alluding to the law of gravity, but also still (purposefully or not) tying in with the other apparent 'scientific' details in this song such as the sun's dwindling illumination and the moon's decorative origins.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"oh, ah, oo, ee<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the melody is drifting into the future\"<br>The melody literally drifts into the future in spectacular key change faction. The vocal non-words are even rearranged so you really feel that 'oo'! </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"and i feel pretty good<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about what time it\n  is<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about what day it ever was and how it came to this\"<br>A feeling of content with the past and how we got here, and maybe even a glimpse of hope for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"ooooh\"<br>'dangmmmmmm..' <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"the memory is drifting back in ways that i'll<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pretend to know and understand<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and i pretend to know exactly how the story will end\"<br>Myself and I'm sure so many others know this feeling, it's so human to think, feel, and perhaps hope you know what will happen next. This completes the themes of storytelling within this song- from knowing what the story will be to pretending you know how it will end. And that story stretches beyond fiction into our own personal narratives, of the past, present and future. No one else really understands that narrative. That's \n where art is sparked and discovered within and throughout and beyond. I really appreciate your music and what you do, thank you for the songs you write and the art you share. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"travel the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walk over the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back to the\"<br>Of course I'm sure this is self explanatory, following the previous lyric.
