People come into the store in waves. As in, the store will be completely empty, then someone comes in, and within about five minutes, 2-3 other people or groups come in after them. Separate groups. From different entrances. Coming in within minutes of each other. CONSISTANTLY. Then they clear out around the same time too. Groups that are NOT TOGETHER. NOT COMMUNICATING. NOT TRAVELING TOGETHER. and yet they are. It's almost totally predictable (there are outliers). And i get that sometimes there are other factors, like the bus stopped here, or it's after the lunch rush and everyone is coming after eating, or there's construction outside bringing people this way, or things like that. But I am not aware of any of that happening. And it's like, are they coordinating, talking to each other on l\n ittle walkie talkies? No! They're just doing it naturally, some how. Is there some other reason that I'm missing? Or do we humans just have some kind of subconscious magnetism to each other??</qco> </h3><br><br><br>"
