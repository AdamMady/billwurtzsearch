But consciousness kinda feels like it takes place outside of the brain, like an extension of itself, the collective whole. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\tIt is absolutely mystifying to me.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t Though when you go to sleep, you have then 'lost' consciousness. Well, where did it go? I'm assuming that this means that everything was sort of 'separate' for a while, which makes sense, because a lot of the brain majorly either slows down or stops completely while asleep, and thus the whole is not there. But it's death that is weird. When you sleep, it can feel like an instant from when you fell asleep to when you woke, but when you die, that instant of being conscious again will (in theory) never come.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t You won't know anything, you won't be anything, and it's that thought that scares me. And it's that thought in which pushes me to slow down on lif\n e and re\n ally focus on the parts I enjoy rather than trying to do things that will get me material things, I don't want a job, I just want to make things, and I just want to be remembered, at least in some capacity, at least for a little while. Sorry if I rambled on for a bit too long there, but I was just wondering if you had any sort of insight or if you have any similar ideas/thoughts at all?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks for reading.&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
