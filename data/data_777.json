Because I'm always too horrified to do them;&nbsp;like everybody just does them as if it's the same as putting together cars on an assembly line but I can't think of the assignments like that, like I can't write something unless I'm sure it's true and meaningful. I guess ideally, I should be able to do that in a timely manner but I just can't, or at least I'm too scared to try. And the classic advice I always get is to not care too much about writing something good, but it just hurts to meaninglessly write for the sake of writing, like what's the point of being a human if you can't create anything with significance? Also it's not like the work that everyone else produces is shitty, it's actually very good which means that if I take the assembly-line approach, not only will the act of it feel horrible, but its product will be worse than what everyone else is somehow able to create with the same method. I\n  dunno, \n I guess I'm asking this because you're definitely someone who makes meaningful content and well, you normally turn it out on a regular basis, so maybe you have some advice on how to accomplish this and perhaps on how you were able to these assignments back when you were in school. Thanks for reading this, I'm sorry if most of it is just a rant.</qco> </h3>"
