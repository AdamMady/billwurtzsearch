Imagery is a big part of your music, so i was wondering if you had any thoughts on this.</qco> </h3>      \nmusic is kind of a secret/special sauce. So this begs the question: how do you eat just the sauce? The idea of paying attention to music separately is actually kind of weird...... and truly it's almost impossible to actually pay direct attention to only music. i think you'll find that SOMETHING has to take the focus. and often, by default, it's the identity of the artist the music is associated with\n<br><br>"

Otherwise it might feel like the animation loop is only 1/3 of the length it actually is. it's important to see the individual clubs changing hands. I made the juggling animation first, and i had 3 different colors just so i could tell them apart. Then i modeled the rooms and did the rest of the animation. Then i had to deal with whether the colors looked good with the scene. There are several moments where 1 club is featured (thrown into the ceiling tile, or onto the light, or when the last 2 go up to the atrium.) So i needed to find a color scheme which looked good with all 3 together, and, also looked good when the individual ones are featured. And switching the clubs at that point was out of the question. so i had to juggle the colors around a bit to make all the scenes look good with the same color scheme. That is generally the meaning of colors: how they look, and how the look feels. And with 3 different but consistent interchanging items, that became somewhat of a puzzle for me\n<br><br>"
