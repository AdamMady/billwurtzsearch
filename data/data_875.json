For the older one, he came to class knowing jingle bells. he likes learning songs. i am thinking of teaching him some chords to play along with jingle bells. but i also am teaching him a bit about the circle of fifths, how it relates to sharps and flats in different keys, and then showing him how jingle bells can be played starting in any note. I am very slowly trying to teach them how to read notes off a pentagram but I feel like that can dampen the excitement for the instrument if it becoems too \"academized\". I took a look at a teaching book and it doesnt look too fun tbh. maybe the best time to teach them to r\n ead musi\n c is when they want to learn a specific song? I can notate it for them and have them read off it? They range ages 4 to 10 probably. Some are more motivated than others but i feel they can all get excited about different aspects of piano/music/learning</qco> </h3>"
