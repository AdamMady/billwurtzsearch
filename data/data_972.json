I find it easy enough to draw the rest of the body as body language doesn't need as much careful consideration, but faces really make me struggle as even the slightest detail changes the observed expression drastically. All of my characters look like they've had their soul vacuumed out by the ghost-busters leaving their faces stiff and without emotion. I've tried a lot of things but none of the satanic rituals worked. So tell me, which ritual did you use to imbue souls into your music without attracting any evil spirits or accidentally haunting the music???&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
