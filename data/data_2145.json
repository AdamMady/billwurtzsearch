There's a lot of heavy, deeply personal stuff that comes out in my lyrics and my drawings that I have never expressed or shared with the people I know. And if any of them see it, it would be dropping a huge bombshell on them, changing their perceptions of me. I'm not really afraid of people not liking it, moreso just people thinking 'what the fuck, man'... I have no problems sharing the stuff I make with complete strangers.. but the thought of having friends or family see it is just downright terrifying for me (nobody even knows that I draw or write lyrics/sing... I only share instrumental stuff with friends)...
