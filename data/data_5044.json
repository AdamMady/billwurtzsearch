I can hear that there is intention behind every single note and it tickles the strange part of my brain that has always obsessively deconstructed all the music I listen to. Now you can say for at least one person, the chords are not a thankless job. Thanks for the cool music!</qco> </h3>"

In most situations where I've sat with a friend in silence it's largely because we're comfortable in each other's presence. We don't need to say anything to fill the air because we are just together. Nothing else is needed in that moment. While tension can exist in silence, doesn't \"what should we talk about during the trip?\" also create tension? regardless of when that's asked?</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It reminds me of trying to force something in a creative project that isn't there. or maybe isn't suited for that project. or instance if lyrics can't be found after so much is developed why try to add it in? It existed fine without it. Does it really need the lyrics to feel whole? Or do you think the project is asking for something different and unexpected to feel more complete? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenging you to find a new solution if you will.
