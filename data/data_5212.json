Learning songs is boring, playing in front of people has no positive effect (it's like playing normally but making a mistake is more embarassing), and I hate learning about music stuff. I find that playing my own little creations is more interesting than anything else but I do not find learning new things fun. So I don't exactly have any idea of what to do about my guitar situation. I have some skill in playing, but no knowledge or want for knowledge of music. I haven't played for months at this point and have considered playing more but I do not know what to play. So I guess what I'm trying to ask through all of this, is, have you gone through times like this, where you do not like music and don't want to play? And, how long did you take to really figure out what you want to do in music? I have a feeling I am thinking about this with too much structure.</font> </h3><br><br>"

So, for instance, would you rather create 100 kind-of okay-ish videos/songs, or 1 really really good one?  And if you found one specific thing that meant the world to you, would you be willing to drop everything to work on just that project, or would you rather be working on having more \"things\" done for people to see at the end of the day?
