About four years ago I finally stepped into making and singing music after growing up in an family that believed music making, esp singing, is the realm of an elite few talented people. I always rebelled against this idea in my heart because but didn't participate in misic making until I left that environment about 4 yrs ago. anyways, after 4 years of singing w a vocal group I could just feel that my voice, my ears, improv and other abilities had become quite strong. About 6 mo ago I leveled up again in my understanding of music and began making/recording my own music and performing more on my own time, not just with my group. So, I know my strongest suit is harmony and singing with others, but recently at a mic night I sang a song (used a mic) by myself, no accompanymnent, which is a first for me. Icould hear myself during and it I was delighted that my voice both sounded and felt good, which i have learned are some of several markers that you are making a good, strong sound. But a friend recorded it, then sent it to me later. I watched it to see what it sojnded like from an audiences persective and it actually didn't sound great, not bad but not good. There were a few notes I thought I nailed but were actually a little shaky, and overall tone was not as strong as I had felt it was in the moment. This devastates me because my body and my ears to ears told me it sounded nice while I was performing, but the actual recorded audio denies this...I feel shattered. So now I am wondering if I should just halt all my musical persuits,\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if I still apparently am not a strong singer even after lots of practice over the last few years and a sense that I had grown into my own voice. I love making music more than anything, and my favorite instrument is voices because it feels so physial and raw to share music that way. but if my soundmaker is fundamentally gross than I feel the whole process is perverted from the get-go. So i'm looking for guidance from friends and musicians I trust: is there anything here that i mentioned you are familiar with and have advice for?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and is it a good idea to trust that wonderful sensation inside you when you are singing that tells you the sound is pleasing?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and thanks for fielding this long ask</qco> </h3><br><br>"
