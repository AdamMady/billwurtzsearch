At some point someone asked \"&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you more inclined to answer a sincere question over a kinda goobed one or is it just a matter of the ones that call out to you?\" and you answered \"all of these questions are ungoobed. the goobed ones don't even get through\" meanwhile some people ask questions like: \"Is mush a goup?\" \"Hello why are mangos yellow\" \"why is it that that that is is that that is not is not is not that it it is\", I believe 'goobed' would be a good descriptor word for these questions. This is not a personal offence to you, I enjoy your music and think you're probably a decent person. I also understand that this is your question board where you are fully within your right to answer whatever questions you want. despite this, I still going to point it out. May you have a good day.\n<br>\n<br>Best regards,\n<br>An Anonymous Internet user</qco> </h3>"
