I can read competently in my target language but with toddler level's understanding of audio messages. so it really blows my mind when I heard someone who learnt foreign languages primarily by listening or there are some amazing creatures called illiterate who can speak a language fluently without understanding its orthography). I've been clueless for really long time, and wh\n en I sea\n rch online I can only see people who got a great ear but have problem reading staff or sth, none of them in the opposite situation. The things I think I can do now is just doing some mechanical ear training exercise i.e. recognize intervals, chords in isolation one by one, or listening for the melody/chords of songs (mentioned in the previous question) in a fruitless and excruciatingly slow way and wonder along whether I practice the right way... any advice on what I should do?
