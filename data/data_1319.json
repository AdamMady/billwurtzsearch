But I can't help but dread that people won't think it's nearly as good as we do. What do I do to combat this dread? It's making me think I could be insane because I love the music so much, but what if people don't like it and it doesn't get to reach as many ears as I want it to? Maybe I'm overthinking and I shouldn't care? Love your stuff, you inspire me every day</qco> </h3><br><br>"
