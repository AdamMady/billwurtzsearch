These are usually the things I write first, the first things I come up with. As I then have to expand on those ideas, I find it's difficult to put together verses or pre-choruses. I feel like I'm out of things to say. I think part of the problem is that these are usually the parts of other peoeple's songs I find least interesting. Like, my favorite \"musical moments\" are often choruses or bridges, and I don't usually think about verses. Ofcourse there are great lyrical moments that I think about all the time, but those are few and far between I suppose. It's like, I just wrote the best part of this song, and now you want me to... write a less interesting part? I don't know how to expand on my ideas in that way. Does that make sense?
