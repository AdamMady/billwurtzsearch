Right where it is, we can subtract 28, which will knock off a zero. 43260, and divide by 10. is 4326. this seems way easy to cut in half, which is a legit transformation, but for now i'll skip that. if you want, you could add 14, to get 4340 -->434. then subtract 14, is 42. bingo, that's a multiple of 7. so 43288 is divisible by 7.<br>\nanother strategy would be to cut it in half several times first, if that feels convenient. 43288 looks pretty easy to cut in half. just look at it like 4 32 88. and cut everything in half. 2 16 44. then again, 1 08 22. look at it like 108 22, now again, 54 11.... So from there, you could add 49 to even it off, or, here's another trick, you can go from the left, it's sometimes much faster. if you can think of a multiple of 7 that's close but below any of the left of the number, you can replace that with the distance away it is. For example- looking at 5411, i can see 54 on the left, and that's clearly 5 above 49. Well you can just replace 54 with 5. 511. Now, you can do it again, just look at 51, clearly 2 above 49. so knock off the 51 and replace it with 2. so you get 21. which is clearly a multiple of 7. so that means the original number was also a multiple of 7, because we have only made transformations which will not destroy its status of whether or not it is a multiple of 7.<br>\nHere's the 'left' method again from the original 43288, without doing all the cutting in half, just to show that it works that way too. 43288, you can clearly see the 43 is 1 above 42. so replace the 43 with just 1. so 1288, and now you can see 12 is 5 above 7, so replace 12 with 5. 588. 58 is just above 56 (2 away), so replace 58 with 2, that's 28. so it works that way too. often going from the left is much quicker.<br>\nAnother example, checking 43288 for 11, well right away just knock off the 88. that's 432. seems easy enough to subtract 22 from the right, so 41. so no.<br>\nTo cheat and show you an example that works, let's check 417521302 for 11. Seems easy to add 88 to the right, that's 417521390, drop the zero is 41752139. now add 11 to the right, 4175215. (dropping zeros as i go, of course). now add 55 to the right, 417527. now add 33 to the right, 41756. now add 44 to the right. 41800, drop zeros, 418. add 22 is 440 = 44, which you should recognize as a multiple of 11. Going from the left may have been quicker but i was actually just too lazy to compare 41 with 33. But if we had done that, from the original 417521302, it would have gone like this-- replace 41 with 8 (because 33 is 8 below 41-- and this only works when 33 is BELOW 41, in otherwords you can't replace with 3 here (44) that won't work). 87521302. You can replace 87 with 10 (87 is 10 above 77) 10521302. you can replace 105 with 6 (because 105 is 6 above 99). 621302. you can replace 62 with 7 (it's 7 above 55). 71302. you can replace 71 with 5 (because it's 5 above 66). 5302. you can replace 53 with 9 (because it's 9 above 44). 902. And you can replace 90 with 2 (because it's 2 above 88). so you're left with 22, which you should recognize as a multiple of 11\n<br><br>"
