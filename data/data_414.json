To me this moment feels symbolic. In the previous lyrics you started questioning your place in the world completely unironically, basically taking off the silly mask you often wear in your music. So that musical moment following it almost feels to me like you're putting the mask back on? Like, the mood got too dark and you lost control of the song, and now you're wrenching control back and making it silly again. Was that interpretation at all intentional or am I crazy?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
