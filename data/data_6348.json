I know V13 is a thing, but I always think that sounds weird unless the 7th is lower than the 13th, which usually makes the chord sound muddy.\n<br>\n<br>The best way I've found is iii with the 5th of the tonic scale in the bass, but that never is quite as satisfying as I want it to be.\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nDo you have a go-to for this situation?
