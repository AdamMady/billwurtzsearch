You feel it's partly because you took longer to learn and asked a lot more questions than the other person, and now your entire department basically doesn't treat you well. Even though now you are fairly confident with your responsibilities and have been doing good work. Should you stay, or pursue a job with a better \"crowd\" of people? I feel like this department I'm with involves a complete clash of personalities between me and them. Also important to note: This job is what I went to school for and pays very well.
