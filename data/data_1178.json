Some mud may be necessary to be cut via EQing (if used in the wrong areas), but it seems like a valid production technique when trying to add some density while maintaining the harmonic colour, if you will. </qco></h3>      absolutely, but it will NOT work if you use the exact same notes in a different octave. what you are trying to achieve will be achieved by using different notes, and i would be delighted to tell you which<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, may add some stereo dimension when taking panning into account. What do you say?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>      as octaves go up and down, you need different amounts of notes to re enforce the same exact sound you had. using the same exact 'notes' in different octaves will make the sound different, in fact dare i say will weaken it and add an 'ick' factor. if you tell me any notes and exactly what octave they are in, i will give you my best suggestion(s) of how to re enforce it while keeping the exact same flavor. you can even tell me how much distortion you happen to have on it. i promise you the answer will never be the exact same notes in a different octave..... that's just not what's gonna re enforce the original sound.  the exception to this is if you started with only 1 note\n<br><br>"

Actually, what i would really recommend is, after doing the drums first, send it to the chordal instruments, then send it to vocals, then send it to bass, then send it back to the drummer with drums muted and a very strong click (oh i forgot to mention you absolutely must have the click in there from the start), then send it back to the chordal instrument(s) and have them re-do that, with the new drums included, then maybe send it to bass to have that redone, then back to vocals, keep going around like this and have the people re-do their parts each time, because each time it gets closer and closer to creating the illusion of people actually playing together, because now they are hearing each other... even better, they are hearing each other do what they did while hearing each other. but i just realized you probably already knew all this. but as far as acoustics, just remember that some people spend millions of dollars on ways to try to deliberately simulate bad acoustics. hope that helps\n<br><br>"
