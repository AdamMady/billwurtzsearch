I'm often told that I come off as a rude and arrogant person even when I don't intend to because I'm blunt and also slightly clueless about social norms. I'm sick of people's expectations but people in general are not willing to help you unless you're conforming? it's so hard to find a balance between being yourself and being what others expect you to be. I used to seek a lot of validation from others before, but now I'm slightly more self-confident. However, a few people have asked me if I'm depressed or something and try to figure out what's \"wrong\" with me (and they try to be subtle about it), and I just get the general feeling that people don't like being in my presence because I'm too uncomfortable or stand-offish. Although I've learned not to mind it too much, I feel this is only going to alienate me further from others and prevent me from getting things done. idk I'm just venting here, sorry</qco> </h3><br><br>"
