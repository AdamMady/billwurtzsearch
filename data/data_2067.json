So I'm way more creative when I'm uncomfortable and irritated and I think it's because my mind is desperate to do something else. Is it the same for you? Idk I find it very interesting. Oh and btw how could I kind of maximize my creative potential when I am comfortable and stuff if that makes sense? Cause it's way harder to generate good ideas in a comfortable setting for me for some reason.&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
