I'm working on the drawing right now yayyyy!!!!!!!!\n<br>I've decided to try my best to make the drawing look different from my past drawings. It just NEEDS to be different, I mean, I haven't done anything in weeks! The problem that I'm currently facing is the idea that the drawing won't be worth the wait.. My audience is waiting for me to post something good, but what if the drawing doesn't end up meeting their expectations? What if the drawing ends up looking the same as my past ones despite my efforts to make it look different and unique?\n<br>Do you ever worry about this kind of stuff?</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t If so, how do you cope with these negative thoughts and worries?</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t Do you simply ignore the thoughts and just hope for the best?
