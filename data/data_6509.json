(The last series of pairs of weeks has again proved it. Thanks for putting your ideas in my head.) I want to learn how to do the same. I know in my heart and brain that moving my body will have the same effect, but I lack the discipline to even do the thing that I know will help. It has just never been a habit, and so I am less fit and I view it as an \"extra\" thing that is hard to do and wastes the time I already am not using well enough. Has running/moving always been a part of your life, or if you had to develop that habit, how do I get from zero but stay there once I start?</qco> </h3>"
