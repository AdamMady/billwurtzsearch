Sometimes you say the opposite of the answer you really mean. I would ask if this is true, but I would have no idea if the answer you give is the true or the opposite of what is true. Apparently people don't always just say direct answers to questions and I don't understand why. Apparently that is autism, but it seems more to me like everyone else is the weird one for not just answering questions directly. And if everyone else knows that you can never know if someone is answering a question directly and honestly, how does anyone function?</qco> </h3>      \nperhaps the problem is that total complete honesty would take an infinite amount of time to express. to answer finitely, requires an absurd amount of simplifation, and the answerer may have to make some big decisions about how to go about doing that. in some cases it may turn out that stronger meaning can be approximated better by going at sort of an oblique angle from the question, especially if there are other important issues that weren't even covered in the question. For example, let's say there is a Tsunami approaching. your friend asks you \"what's 2 plus 2\". and instead of saying \"4\", you answer \"aaaaah there's a Tsunami approaching\"\n\n<br><br>"
