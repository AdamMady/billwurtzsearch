I left a question half a year ago and after a while I believe your process of making work has rubbed off on me. You're a very inspirational person to me and you believe your advice on things have given me a better outlook on my work and what I should do if I have writers block or when I begin to doubt my work. So thank you Bill.\n<br>2nd half of this question. This first semester at college I didn't do so well. I have a tendency to do my work later which ends up making me submit them late. I understand the importance of college and getting work in on time. Do you have any suggestions for habit forming so I can quit the mentality of doing work later?</qco> </h3>"
