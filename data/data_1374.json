At the start of this year I travelled overseas for the first time and was lying on the terminal floor with my travel buddy waiting for the flight out. I was absolutely crapping myself with anxiety coz when I was a kid I witnessed a fatal plane accident and I'd never been over water in a plane and was overthinking like crazy. Anyway. I opened up YouTube for the first time in ages to try to find something to distract myself and at the top was Airport Terminal. I thought \"oh wow that's a cool coincidence\" and I watched it and it calmed me right down because it made the whole experience seem like a cool adventure. Thanks very much for unknowingly helping me. Also, the editing in that video is fucking stupendous and it blows my mind to think of the amount of work you put into it.&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
