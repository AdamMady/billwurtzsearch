Now that I'm really close to publically publishing an album, I'm starting to think I understand the reason why better perhaps. Even it doesn't apply to the majority of musicians, I'm guessing I'm not the only one with this feeling I currently have. I feel like i'm getting stressed that an unknowable amount of people, will be able to see the shortcomings that i percieve in myself. When I create a song, and only share it with myself, and people i trust, it remains really easy to just reflect on it in a calm and happy manner. I'm not sure i'll be able to do that once that music becomes public however. It slightly makes me wonder if i should back out of publishing my music. Do you have any advise on how to keep calm and move on?</qco></h3>"

It's kind of like my brain is trying to trick me into thinking that's not it, but the downside is that it does not give me insight into how to make it better. I have noticed now that it is very similar to what I would do when producing music and I would just add reverb to make it feel \"full\" or \"better\" and kind of ignore the fact that my sound selection and/or voicings and/or arrangement are not great to begin with. And now that I have seen this in 2 different worlds (visual and audio) I can't help but wonder all the other ways my brain has done that same process throughout life for me.
