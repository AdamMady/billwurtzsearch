There was also another switch labeled \"automatic/manual\" that probably had to do with a handheld button similar to the ones you see on Jeopardy! that would have allowed me to control the lights. The button was connected with a 1/4-inch plug like on serious headphones audiophiles buy for thousands of dollars. That was so neat! Of course I didn't touch anything because I don't want to be responsible for any car accidents. Have you ever had a similar experience?</qco> </h3>"
