This has been a huge help for me because I'm starting to be very encouraged by a huge growing library, and also starting to see some patterns and directions in all these little ideas, and all this helps me come up with new ideas to fill in the gaps. The part that I'm having trouble with though is the part where I'm supposed to work on a song and \"don't switch to a different one until you've made significant progress\"? Another fun issue that I've been dealing with for years, is re-writing songs. When I do go back to try to expand upon old ideas and fragments, I wind up making changes to the original idea and not adding anything new.. Sorry, this is long.. but I just wish I had more finished 'products' to show for all my little ideas and stuff.</qco> </h3>      ah, you must complete the 12 levels of suffering, then the 13th which is the unlucky last and final level; the reason it is unlucky is because after you finish it you will be informed that there is another level after that \n<br><br>"
