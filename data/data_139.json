The second reason is because the dot on the i can be seen like an eye, giving it a more personal feel. in addition to these reasons NOT to capitalize that particular word, i also have no idea what good it does to capitalize it, and other languages don't do it either. of all the pronouns, it's kind of hilarious that we choose that one to capitalize\n<br><br>"
