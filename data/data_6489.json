Do you think I should play more piano to learn how to improv better (follow the sound in my head with my hands) or study more music theory to improv better?</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or maybe do the first one first and then gradually apply music theory to what I'm doing so I can analyze and understand what I'm doing, and thus do it better and more consistently in the future?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I'm considering getting an electric keyboard even though we have a really grand grand piano in our house because it would help me write/improv music without worrying about what my family members hearing it (I would use headphone plug-ins) because I've heard that professional musicians limit the part of their brain that worries about what other people think while they're improv-ing and until I'm brave enough to do that I think it would be nice to have a private environment to try this in.
