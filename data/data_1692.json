Science actually becomes more useless the more fundamental you get, so a TOE would actually be the ultimate useless thing. There are many many things (in fact, the overwhelming majority of things in this world) that a TOE would not actually explain because no one outside of string theorists actually do science from first principles (deriving everything from quantum mechanics, etc). People just try to come up with models that fit their data. Please ask me if you need me to elaborate on any of this.</qco> </h3>"
