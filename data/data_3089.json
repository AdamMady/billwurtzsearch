However there's another obvious way to see / feel it that causes it to give off really bad vibes. After catching those vibes when listening to a mixdown afterwards, it almost felt like I accidentally released demons during recording. But then I remembered the original intent. Basically the lyrics are kind of a joke and on their own are harmless, but there's still a well-intended normal base meaning I had while creating the song. I arranged and recorded everything fully seriously given that base meaning. Every word I sang was me singing about that base meaning and meaning it, and every piece of instrumentation was realizing the base meaning. However the joke lyrics taken at face value with the intentional arrangement and recordings create a weird vibe. I'm still going to release it, but it's an odd situation. I've learned that when you're making music you're kinda playing with fire because you're really playing with the human experience. Have you ever created unintentional vibes from a song or video?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
