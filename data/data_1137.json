I don't even know what to write about but I love music so much that I just have to make songs. what should I do?</qco> </h3>      \na good method people sometimes use for tuning a guitar string, is to bend it far out of tune, and then bend it gradually back up into tune. well, i think this might be a good strategy for songwriting, if you are feeling lost. Shoot way outside the boundaries of what anyone may think a 'song' is supposed to be..... and then gradually dial it back into more reasonable territory. i guarantee there will be some wild discoveries along the way\n<br><br>"

For a regular screen, the only options i know of are red/blue, and mirror offset. red/blue makes your head wanna explode and it ruins the colors in the video. And with mirror offset, you're gonna see extra copies of the entire screen on either side.
