And then, at another time, in another suit, at another desk, as a different employee, you will get down to work in a nice, quiet place. Which idea the 'worker' chooses to work on will have nothing to do with which idea was created first, or last, or anything else. There will need to be another decision system that chooses which idea to do when. and i don't know what the best way is, that is something you will have to manage within the company as a whole. but if all else fails, computer aided random number selection does work. So actually there is 3 job titles. the dreamer (idea creator) the worker (who works on the idea) and the manager, who SOMEHOW has to decide what idea to work on. i think it is very important that the worker and the manager do not play the same role at the same time-- the worker needs to never question the authority of the decision to work on the project at hand, or else they will not be able to focus on making that project the best it can be. the manager needs to make that decision, and then tell the worker what the project is.\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n9:40 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> how would you call that section in \"got to know what's going on\" right before the last choruses? the bit that goes \"open the door, cuz i got to know what we came here for, whatever it is i'll believe it\". it doesn't \"feel\" like part of the bridge since it imitates the verse, chorus and prechorus sections. my best guess would be to call it a \"summary\" but that's not a musical term afaik</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i just call it a 'quiet verse.' i've never found a better name for it. it specifically means the verse that occurs nearing the end of the song, after at least 2 choruses have happened and usually after the bridge if there is one. the dynamic drops low, it mimics the verse, and very often jumps back up to a high dynamic to usher into the last chorus(s). very standard technique. in this case we've used a half-length-verse, and also a half-length pre-chorus. \n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n8:54 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> <a href=\"do-you-sleep-because-timestamps.html\">I went through a considerable amount of questions you answered, checking their time stamps and estimating when you sleep and how much.

As in there are always 6 quaver beats in the bar but not necessarily grouped in 3 crotchets/quarter notes/whatever (ie 3/4). Essentially like a musical lowest common denominator if that makes sense?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that seems mathematically true, but in reality 6/8 is almost always grouped in 2 groups of 3. in reality 6/8 almost always means 2/1-and-a-half but that would be a mindfuck to write on a piece of paper. if it's 3 groups of 2 it almost always is written as 3/4. although there are many songs that borrow back and forth between the two feels. especially in west africa\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n7:15 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> \"and that's how I do it\" that last \"do it\" is so satisfactory and I don't know why. I can play music on various instruments but I don't really know music theory. is there a reason why that part gives me that feeling?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think it's because \"do it\" is put in a place where you would think only one syllable would fit. but i fit two! they have to snuggle up\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n7:03 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> If you were a billionare would you still be a youtuber</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i prefer not to label people based on sites they may have used\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n6:11 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> If a banana was our form of currency would that make Africa one of the richest places ever and the rest of the non banana growers would be screwed?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no. Africa already does have many extremely valuable commodities and resources. and unfortunately what usually happens is it is taken from them by someone more financially and/or militarily powerful. in the old days by conquest, in more modern times perhaps via predatory loan\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n6:09 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Why do some of your older videos oscillate in video speed (e.g. rising out of bed, here's a bowl, my foot, etc.)?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using speed and time are important tools in my tool kit. i'm not sure if that answers your question\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n4:12 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> What do you use your guitar for?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;videos\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n2:45 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> So the paradox is, you need help in order to do all this crazy stuff quickly.

So you can't have any major help, but it'd be super helpful to have major help, am I getting that right?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes that is exactly right. it's almost as if we need to think outside the box to make this work\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n2:19 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Have you ever considered writing and recording something heavily multi-tracked/overdubbed and experimenting with multiple voices?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i usually like to use a quantity of instruments and voices that is \"just right\"\n\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n1:56 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> what keeps you from killing yourself?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the stuff i still want to do\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n1:15 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> <a href=\"email-large.html\">why is the email written on your email page so big</a></qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n10:55 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> why don't you allow ads on your videos? </qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kills the vibe big time<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people who dont like ads will just use adblock so it won't bother anyone.</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that's not true. not everyone uses ad block. maybe they don't know how. maybe it doesn't work on their system. maybe they had an old one that doesn't work for everything anymore. some people don't even know it exists. not everybody has that whole thing figured out, but i understand that you probably do\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n10:11 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> you mentioned that you break down a project into small tasks and do each of them in an assigned time frame.</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i don't remember saying that<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you know how much time is needed for each small task?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i don't\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n9:20 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Do you have all the answers?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i have some of them\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n9:16 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> will you make more videos of medium size?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oh hell yeah\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n9:10 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> do you really enjoy making longer videos, or the reason why you do more of them now is because they get more recognition?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm just trying to be reasonable\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n9:07 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> yo bill man <a href=\"mbti.html\">what's your mbti</a></qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n8:55 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> how much is your content directly influenced by other viral content?</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not at all<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I notice that \"house building checklist\" has a similarity to one of tomska's asdfmovies, </qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i've never seen a tomska video, but i do know that he has been subscribed to me for a long time<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while \"Are You the Real You\" seems related to dhmis4 - </qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i've never heard of that channel<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coincidence or not?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coincidence or perhaps they were influenced by me\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.13.17&nbsp;\n8:45 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Why the robots.txt file?

'not so hard to do' was just bringing the collection down. i just didn't like it. i think i would have been more comfortable putting it there if there had been more other videos there. and  i took down the 'foot' video because the suggested video images that popped up on screen afterwords were horrifying. they were all like insane foot diseases etc. it was very overwhelming, and they came up instantly after my video. it was just too much. i normally don't pay attention to that sort of thing, but this was right when i was first using youtube and i was pretty uncomfortable with that,

The very next thing he tells us is that he drives a car thats stuck in a tree. He then goes on to admit he was lying and that his real name isn't steve. he then says that he's filing for an extension on his taxes because he didn't pay them but in the same sentence says doesn't plan to do them. Why? Because \"thats the way he likes to live his life and he feels like everything's gonna be fine\". The day ends. The next day he tells the viewer that hes skipping work again, implying he does it frequently, but clarifies that its because hes unemployed. The mailman delivers mail but he adds the details that he was late and wa\n s actual\n ly a woman. She then breaks into the same jingle steve did earlier saying \"thats the way i like to live my life...\" . All of a sudden theres a change of scenery and he starts talking about mountains that we can see are right behind his house yet he says \"I don't remember why i first saw the mountains\". He then says that they've ALWAYS been there. He wonders why they're there but whether he knows or not he has to accept that they're there. He says that he can't claim them. Then he does a complete 180 and states that he can and does so very quickly. He then starts the jingle from before. \"Thats the way i like to live my life..\" but he gets cut off right as he starts, its another mail delivery. This time the person delivering it is a bird but he doesn't mention anything about it nor does he mention anything about the mail being delivered straight to him rather then to his house. The mailman doesn't break into a jingle this time, only saying \"heres the mail.\" The letter is adres\n sed to s\n teve despite that not being his name, which he points out, and it asks how he climbed the mountain. Steve says he glad the person asked and gives a simple answer saying that its a simple two step process, first find the mountain, then climb it. After this steve breaks into the last jingle of the video but this time he says \"Thats the way we can get things done and thats how I do it, its easy and simple cause you know what to do.\" Steve stands there smiling when a downpour starts but steve doesn't react at all simply standing there and smiling. A 5 day weather forecast pops up on screen showing nothing but rain for each day and it moves rapidly showing rain for many more days then 5. Steve then says \"bye i'm steve\" despite saying it wasn't his name earlier and the screen cuts to black.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Part 2: Breakdown of Steve\n<br>\n<br>This is obviously a very confusing story. The main character \"steve\" makes many contradictory and strange statements and bizarre things ha\n ppen wit\n h no explanation. To fully understand this we need to look at the story part by part then look at the big picture. First of all why does steve introduce himself as steve and then say thats not actually his name? The character steve seems to represent many things throughout the story, at times he operates the same as any normal person, or character in a story might but at other times he does very strange things. He changes his identity and says things that are impossible such as him driving a car in a tree, theres also a point where a talking bird delivers him mail. Steve doesn't pay taxes and doesn't have a job, He's also secluded from others in the mountains. These traits are indicative of multiple personality disorder and schizophrenia. The viewer isn't a character in the story but he talks to the viewer, rather then just narrating whats happening I think steve is talking to himself and the viewer is seeing whats happening through his eyes, this is why we saw the bird talk\n ing. The\n  first real thing does in the story is file for an extension on his tax returns and then say he wont ever be paying them. Although this statement may seem like he doesn't plan to pay what he owes, I think whats actually happening is steve doesn't owe anything at all. Steve doesn't appear to live in a city but rather a rural area with mountains so it may be either he is excused from paying taxes because of his mental ailments or the government of his country doesn't require its citizens to pay taxes.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Part 3: breakdown of events\n<br>\n<br>First, Either way the point of him filing for an extension is pointless,\n</qco></h3> &nbsp;\"filing for an extension on my taxes\" i thought was a nice line for that point in the video because it was a nice contrast to the much simpler items that come before it (drive a car, in a tree, what's your name, that type of stuff.) it was fun to jump to something much more 'grownup' and verbose. but the line also has a twist at the end because he says he's never going to pay the taxes. which i thought was a fun idea because if he's not going to pay them, then why is he filing for an extention, right<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp; he also says he doesn't have a job. </qco></h3> &nbsp;this is almost an identical strategy to the taxes line. i'm skipping work again today (which seemed neat because it implies that you skip work a lot, so shouldn't you have been fired by now?) but adding \"because i don't have a job\" i just thought was a nice twist.<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;steve appears to live a life without a goal. </qco></h3> &nbsp;steve is unpredictable. i wouldn't jump to conclusions. also there is a large goal coming up just a few seconds later which spoiler alert he achieves<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;He's secluded in the mountains </qco></h3> &nbsp;that's not necessarily true yet at this point in the video<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;and his mental afflictions may prevent him from growing or working towards something meaningful. His random bursts into jingles show how childlike his mental state is and the flashing colors show his warped views of reality. </qco></h3> &nbsp;the flashing colors are not necessarily seen by steve, they are seen by the viewer. and the music is not necessarily something that steve is actually doing or taking part in, it is just a device for the viewer. think of theatrical musical productions. the characters break into song, but are we really expected to believe that the characters spontaneously sing songs that seem pre writen, about their lives, and it is already fully rehearsed and harmonized with multiple characters taking part, AND with musical accompaniment coming from seemingly nowhere?<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;Despite this he t\n hinks ev\n erything is going to be ok and his more or less happy with himself. </qco></h3> &nbsp;this first jingle takes it to an emotional level for the first time, i think at the right time. it reflects emotionally on what happened, for the first time. whereas the previous events (car, tree, etc) might lead you to think this story is just going to be a series of him telling you 'then i this, then i that.' but after about the 3rd or 4th thing i think it's important to stop for a minute to sing a simple song of human emotion, optimism, and reflection upon the events. sure it's a bit careless because we're kind of neglecting the tax situation, but that's not the strangest thing that's happened so far, in fact this first jingle seems to be the first bit with no new information, which in itself makes it feel new in that regard, because as i said we are getting to an emotionally reflective level on previous events, for the first time, without piling on new events emotionlessly.<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;One day the mailman delivers the mail </qco></h3> &nbsp;that's not true. it is implied that she delivers the mail every day, like most mail carriers do. <h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;and this is when he starts to say something rational although pointless and unneeded. </qco></h3> &nbsp;the point of this scene (next day, mailman, etc) is to generally keep the ball rolling on the new information and situations, and to continue to keep you guessing as to what is going on. we've already set the stage in 'verse 1' with the name, car, tree and stuff, now the idea is to sort of continue the game.<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;He says the mailman was actually a woman and was late, despite this statement being unneeded it makes sense and theres no indication of it being false. </qco></h3> &nbsp;the point of the 'woman' line is, again, we're adding a twist to the end of the line. like the end of the taxes line, or the end of the skipping work line. the idea of a mailman who is a woman seems fun to me because the word 'mailman' sounds like it's a man. but it's actually a woman. and i just thought it was an interesting place to reveal someone's gender. <h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp; Yet when the mailman comes she also bursts into the same jingle steve was doing. </qco></h3> &nbsp;right. i figured it was a nice time to go back into that jingle, because it is almost sooner than you would expect, but it is familiar, so things don't get too crazy just yet. and the twist here is, it almost sounds as though she's singing about her gender, almost as if she chose to be that gender. i figured this was probably a nice touch, because gender freedom is something that i think we've all been thinking about more and more these days. but again it's not totally clear why she is singing it. it is left slightly up in the air, which again i think is a nice strategy especially for a video like this where you are never quite sure what the heck is going on.<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp; The mailman may have similar mental issues to steve and the two of them are just role-playing, She isn't dressed like a mailman and its never said that she delivers anything to steve, simply dances and leaves. </qco></h3> &nbsp;i was planning on giving her some kind of postal uniform, but she looked better wearing the same type of clothes as steve. <h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp; She also doesn't identify herself as a mailman but steve does, maybe its because she did deliver something to steve without him realizing. </qco></h3> &nbsp;no one really knows why paper mail carriers are there anymore. nowadays we mostly use email for everything. which is another reason why 'mailman' seems like a fun idea. everyone knows what it is, and it seems familiar, yet in the back of your mind, what are they really doing? it's just a person who visits your house every day. which seems nice\n<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;Steve might have just imagined the mailman doing the jingle as well. I think the two most important things here are that first of all the mailman was late, in the way that steve is late to life. As a fully grown adu\n lt </qco></h3> &nbsp;that is not necessarily true<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;he st\n ill acts like a kid but the mailman \"delivered\" something to him, a doctor delivering medicine. </qco></h3> &nbsp;that's not true at all. if she were delivering medicine i would have used an icon that looked more like medicine, not envelopes. also this is off the subject but i just realized you did not notice that steve's house does not have a door. \n<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;Steve gains newfound clarity and sees the mountains behind him. </qco></h3> &nbsp; the point of the mountains is to add a new larger twist to the feel of the video. we've already gone through some 'daily' sounding sort of riff raff (cars, names, mail, paperwork, etc.) and we've also seen the same jingle twice, so it almost feels like we're in a pattern. so time for something bigger, different, at a different pace. the mountains scene is at a much slower pace, much more of an ominous, deep feeling.\n<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;The mountains are his mental problems, the things he can't do becase of his mental condition. </qco></h3> &nbsp;that's the most unexpectedly dismal analysis i could possibly imagine<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;He doesn't know why he first saw them, </qco></h3> &nbsp;i tried to put some very subtle and peculiar inconsistencies in the way the grammar is phrased here. you might think it should say 'suddenly i saw the mountains which i had never noticed becore, and i don't remember them being there.' but it's different to say ' i don't remember Why i first saw them.' basically i'm taking common phrases but turning them around just a little bit in ways that i haven't quite heard before, but they feel the same. <h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;he wasn't aware that he was being medicated but they've always been there, just like his mental issues. He feels like he'll never be able to climb them but after the delivery </qco></h3> &nbsp;there was no delivery. steve's house doesn't have a door. <h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;he is able to right away. </qco></h3> &nbsp;right. again, using pacing and timing here. after a long ominous segment about the mountains seeming impenetrable and immoveable, downright unclimbable, we suddenly kill the music and ominous tones and unexpectedly we can climb the mountains. what's more is, i used present tense for both. so it's not even like 'i couldn't climb them, but now i can' it's an even more sudden switch than that, 'i can't climb them but i can' it's most like a quantum mechanical paradox. and it's off to the races, we jump back into the jingle because that's what you might expect, but usually it's a good practice to stay one step ahead of the audience. they already get the idea. so there is an interruption immediately<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;The medicine is working.\n</qco></h3> &nbsp;medicine is a fun sounding and interesting concept, like mail, cars, or trees. it is likely that this video Could have had scenes about medicine, maybe if it continued, or if i wrote another similar video. if i wanted to use the idea of medicine, i would do it in a way that actually mentions it, because i do think it is a fun thing to mention. i have done other videos and tweets which mention the idea. i would not do it in a secret and dark way, that is not my idea of a good time<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>As soon as he reaches the top he tries to do his jingle but he can't, he's no longer happy. </qco></h3> &nbsp;that's ridiculous. the reason this jingle stopped is clearly an interruption from the mailbird. and it's very casual in nature. there is no indication that steve is disappointed by being interrupted. it's very casual.<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;Theres another delivery but the person delivering it is a bird. This could be steves issues presenting themselves once again, but he doesn't say anything. </qco></h3> &nbsp;it's just another surprise, intertwined with something familiar (the mail). the surprise is that there is mail on the top of the mountain, and how did it come so quickly, how did anyone know steve was up there, etc etc etc. and it's a bird because why not. also i have no idea what kind of bird that is. some people said it was a kiwi but i just made something up. the script said it was actually supposed to be a penguin, but i was working off phone timers to get this thing done (video making takes a long time, you gotta stay on top of the time) so i just drew the fastest thing i could. turned out to probably not be a penguin.<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;The medication didn't solve the underlying problems but merely allowed him to hide them, </qco></h3> &nbsp;there is no medication in this video but i have noticed that there is a lot of medication in this analysis.<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;this is why he sees a bird but makes no comment. To someone not seeing it through steves eyes he would seem normal.</qco></h3> &nbsp;again, just trying to keep it interesting. sure the mailman is a bird and it's on top of a mountain etc etc, but this is all part of the counter-swing of the pendulum from the slow, deep segment before about the mountain. from the suddenly climbing the mountain, it's light quick jumps, and before you know it we're reading a letter, and it's suddenly a q&amp;a video, which at this point seems appropriate because what the fuck is happening so far in this video, it's about time we start taking some questions.<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;\n This is\n shown again when hes called steve and despite him not thinking that its his name he just says \"whatever\" and goes along with it, he doesn't know he's steve but he just hides the fact he thinks he isn't. </qco></h3> &nbsp;this part was fun, because it was an excuse to bring back the name ambiguity. obviously the letter should say 'dear steve' because you naturally think this guy's name is steve, because the video is called 'hi i'm steve' with him in the picture, and the first thing that happens in the video is you see the guy tell you his name is steve. so honestly even i forgot his name wasn't steve, until i said it (\"dear steve\") and then i instantly realized the fun built-in opportunity to reference the name ambiguity here, which sort of anchors that as a recurring theme. also gives steve a chance to mug to the camera which i thought was neat. was very careful on the facial expression here so as to not seem too mad nor too happy. just kind of shrugging it off. <h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;\nHe starts being interviewed about how he solved his mental issues, maybe by a doctor or family member. </qco></h3> &nbsp;that's not true, he is asked what i think is a very obvious question, how did he climb this mountain which he seemingly just climbed in 2 seconds. that question seemed to be the most important and relevant question at that time in the video. there are other questions, but that seemed especially relevant because it is about something very large that just happened moments ago. (also another added twist is how did someone ask this via postal mail so quickly)<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;He gives a very simple answer that isn't very helpful at all because he doesn't know how he climbed the mountain and his issues are still there, they just went up the mountain with him but he keeps up the image of being a normal person. </qco></h3> &nbsp;i think the more important part of this section is the part just before he gives the explanation. he looks in the air for a minute, and i feel like we're really not sure what tone this video is going to take. honestly the \"well i'm glad you asked that\" is something that's been lingering in my head for a long time, there is a music video for a 1988 song called 'da butt', and in the intro to the video, spike lee is interviewed and he answers the question starting just like that 'well i'm glad you asked that' in a very similar tone and i just thought it was great. so that type of tone on that line has been stuck in my head for a while now. and as for the 2 step program, i think a detailed setup with bluntly simple contents is always a nice device i think, i have done it in a lot of my videos, and i have always fallen in love with it seeing it other places. (there is a tweet somewhere, not mine, that says \"parts of the worm\" and listed underneath it just says \"worm.\") it's just a fun device, set things up formally and yet have the contents be way more simple than you expected it. And, getting metaphorical about the mountains, let's say it does represent challenges and obstacles (which i think it does) sometimes there is really no good explanation for solving them. you just do it. but actually now that i think about it, this 2 step program is very important because a lot of people miss the first step. identifying the problem is so incredibly important and solving it actually gets surprisingly easier when you just identify the problem! so actually i wholeheartedly believe in that explanation.<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;he does a jingle but its different this time, </qco></h3> &nbsp;yes, it's time for another jingle! and let's do a different one this time because we've already surely exhausted the other one.<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;theres no mention of him being alright or happy </qco></h3> &nbsp; i think the music sounds very, very happy. he's also smiling and dancing. and the lyrics to the jingle are very happy. this part of the video screams happiness with flying colors, but i respect your opinion\n<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;he just says that he solved his problems. </qco></h3> &nbsp;that's not quite what it says, it is more of a conclusion to his quick lesson. this is a general celebration that problem solving is possible.<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;His issues are never solved until the end. The rain starts and steve just keeps standing there and smiling despite the heavy downpour and he doesn't go into a jingle or say anything and the weather forecast shows never ending rain. Steve is depressed. The medication is making him a depressed mess keeping his\n schizoph\n renia and mpd inside but he's no longer happy. </qco></h3> &nbsp;yikes, i am starting to wish i never read this analysis. so depressing. \nok so after this 3rd jingle, there really is a sense of conclusion to this video, it seems like everything that's gonna happen has happened. we've used words, music, together in all the fun usual ways that i like to use them in videos. so what else can be done? well, weather speaks very loudly, at least to me, especially rain. basically the entire video up until this point has been full of words and music, the only thing left to do was rain. no words, no music. it was probably just about the last twist that i could have gotten mileage out of. it feels like stepping out of the paradigm of the video, again because no words no music. this is just what rain actually sounds like in real life.  and again, i think it still keeps you guessing about what is going to happen next. the length of this section is really sort of the 'big finish' of the video. like i said, it feels complete at this point, so we go heavy on the rain, dragging out the time (even showing a weather graphic that further represents this time drag, showing endless rain in the future) and wrap it up! <h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;Everntually steve accepts that this wont change. He says \"Bye i'm steve\" showing that he's lost who he truly is, </qco></h3> &nbsp;given that this line is almost exactly the same as the first line of the video, it seems hard to argue that we're \"lost.\" seems more charactaristic of something being \"found.\"\n...A couple of nice bonuses i found in the last line, 1. it sounds exactly like the first line (hi/bye rhymes) 2. you don't normally introduce yourself when you leave, which makes for an interesting sounding phrase that you don't hear too often, and 3. adding further controversy to the name issue, as if he just admitted his name was steve? either way it's nice closure because he said that at the beginning as well. <h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;he doesn't make an effort to find the happy person he was before by saying hes not actually steve and kills himself. </qco></h3> &nbsp;i wish i never read this<h3 style=\"display: inline;\"> <qco> &nbsp;This is a dark commentary on how the mentally ill live in todays society and the overmedication not being an answer. Steve was fine before anyone decided his pointless life wasn't ok and after they decided they fixed him steve lost the person he was when he was happy and can no longer bear his own life.﻿</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n &nbsp;i can't believe i responded to this. this is terrible\n\n\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.8.17&nbsp; \n5:29 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> speaking on behalf of your entire audience, i'd like to ask you to ignore people who claim to speak on the behalf of your entire audience.</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oh that's classic\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.8.17&nbsp;\n4:49 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> what did you do between the releases of hotewig and \"in california\"? did it take 3 weeks to do this one song, or did you do something else in the meantime?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i wanted to be extra careful on that one because it was the first one in a while. then somewhere in the 2nd or 3rd week i realized this could go on forever and that is when i firmly set the weekly song schedule, which was a stressful time crunch but very liberating and exciting, as always\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.8.17&nbsp;\n4:29 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> ..will you ever <a href=\"collab.html\">collaborate</a>?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.8.17&nbsp;\n4:14 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> <a href=\"what-is-steves-real-name.html\">if steve's name isn't steve, then what is it?</a></qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.8.17&nbsp;\n4:05 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> <a href=\"how-long-did-it-take-to-make-hi-im-steve.html\">How long did it take to create your new video?

but what if you're allowed to choose which piece of trash to use? you won't be able to think clearly. because part of the reason it works is because you know you have to be stuck with that thing, and you have to figure out how to make it good. if you're allowed to choose what thing to start with then you're just going to constantly question if you're working on the right thing and you're going to get cold feet on every project immediately because you're not sure if it's the right project, and you won't have any brain power left to actually figure out what to do on the project because you will be busy second guessing whether it's the right project. so that's why it helps to get all your choices into a list and make a firm plan to do whatever project is decided by the randomizer. one of the main places i've used this is when picking what songs to record. i've written hundreds of songs throughout the years, and there are so many left to be recorded. so usually when i put out a song i pick from this list. every song has tiny reasons why i think \"oh that's the wrong song for right now\" but if you have that attitude you're never going to be comfortable picking a song. i always try to 'actually choose the right one' but my confidence in the decision collapses every time, and i have to randomize. as a result i have recorded some songs that i probably never would have chosen otherwise, but i was able to make them into something good because i wasn't questioning the entire decision while trying to make the thing. i think a lot of artists use randomization in various ways when they feel there are too many choices. i also often get a random word suggestion as a starting point for writing tweets\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.8.17&nbsp;\n1:18 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Do you have lots of future projects planned or do you prefer to make them up on the spot?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a lot of both\n\n<br><br><h3> <dco>7.8.17&nbsp;\n12:01 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Do you buy all your views then put out low effort stuff and pretend it has a deeper meaning and fool everyone into thinking you're some kind of artist genius or something</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no<br><br><h3> <dco>7.7.17&nbsp; \n10:21 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> if not steve doesn't have a job why does he have to pay taxes. am i missing something or am i being dumb?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could be property taxes<br><br><h3> <dco>7.7.17&nbsp; \n9:58 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> <a href=\"dont-understand.html\">Buffalo or giraffe?</a></qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><h3> <dco>7.7.17&nbsp; \n9:57 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> does \"orange\" rhyme with \"four inch\"?&nbsp;</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i would say so<br><br><h3> <dco>7.7.17&nbsp; \n9:30 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> You are making videos less frequently and longer since you made \"history of japan\", is it that you don't want to upset your audiences?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i am making content at the same pace. but longer videos take longer to make. i hope that makes sense<br><br><h3> <dco>7.7.17&nbsp; \n9:15 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> You made a slight change to your YouTube description.
