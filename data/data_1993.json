Dividing 2 by 1/2 is 4, by 1/3 is 6, etc. In other words, the smaller the fraction, the higher the multiplication. Extrapolating, you can see that dividing by zero is (abstractly) the same as multiplying by infinity. So dividing by zero doesn't give you a real answer because infinity is an abstract concept (whereas numbers are abstract concepts that can have sort-of tangible real-life equivalents).
