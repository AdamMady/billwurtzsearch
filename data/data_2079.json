Playing the different modes while keeping the root the same is actually a big help in hearing the different qualities of each one. Thanks! But, wouldn't thinking in terms of modes mostly come in handy when you have a song where the harmony is just kind of vamping on 1 chord for a long time (or maybe multiple chords, but that change slowly.. as in, one chord every few bars or whatever)? \n\n\n</qco></h3>      \nyes, i would say so. a famous example is \"so what\" by miles davis. (dorian). another example would be \"the way you make me feel\" by michael jackson which i just realized is a bar by bar chord rip of \"on broadway\" (mixolydian) or at least before they go to the 4 chord it just vamps on mixolydian. dorian and mixolydian are really the main ones that you are going to find useful in \"music.\" lydian, like i said, comes in handy if you want to create the childlike wonder found in the opening of a 1990s steven spielberg movie, and \"ionian\" and \"aeolian\" are just another name for regular major and regular minor. the other remaining 'strange' ones are not so useful because if u are gonna be strange you are better off being strange on your own without restriction\n\n\n<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nI guess it's really important to establish what the root is. Like C lydian is technically G major, so if you want it sound lydian and not like G major, you really gotta focus in on C and F# in the melody and hammer it in that you're not in plain old G major.</qco></h3>      just play and see what works<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess thinking in terms of modes is mostly useful when you're really going for that specific quality/sound the modes have? </qco></h3>      i think the point of modes is so we have an easy name for that time when you want a minor scale but u want to keep the natural 6. (dorian). or that time when u want a major scale but you want the flat 7 (mixo). that's the main way modes are used, in the business. and no one ever says 'modes' really, you would just say \"major\", \"minor\", \"dorian\", or \"mixo.\" as far as the sequence of 7 'modes', that's just a red herring, to throw young music students off the trail and confuse them and get them to think they don't understand music when in reality music is as easy to understand as tender lovemaking<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way I was taught it (way back when I was taking lessons still) was to use modes when 'soloing over chord changes'. Like, if you have (to chose a boring, textbook example) a I-vi-ii-V in C, that you think ionian over the I, aeloian over the vi, dorain over the ii and mixolydian over the V. But that was never helpful to me to think in those terms.</qco> </h3>      ew, that's terrible advice, when playing over 1,6,2,5 sequence in C, just play in C! more specifically just get used to playing over 1,6,2,5 in C. and like maybe learn how to hit the F note when it lands on the d minor, but your ears (if you have them) should easily point you there. if you are thinking about an entire 'scale' for each chord individually you are going to have a very bad time and the listener will too\n\n<br><br>"
