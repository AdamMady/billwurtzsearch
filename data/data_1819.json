Another thing i learned, on the subject of working faster, is, ... work faster. you gravitate toward what matters. and it is so easy to lose your mind if you listen to that damn thing for too long. you'll just lose your mind ...... another way to get tips is watching a billion mixing tutorials and tips videos until you realize they are all starting to contradict each other, and then you forget it and do what you want\n<br><br>"
