It's not gonna be a great movie, of course, because A) my friends and I that wanna so it are 14-16 yrs old, plus my sister, who is 12, B) I'd have to borrow camera equipment, and still have to find someone who can edit, and C) we don't have much money to spend on props or a set or anything. luckily I think we can work through these, but here's my question: do you have any advice for... any of this? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you make cool videos a lot, and IDK, I thought maybe you might.
