I've always been interested in music, and I've been making songs on my computer for a few years now, but I'm not very good at it and it's always a struggle. However, I have a feeling that getting a keyboard (I've never played an instrument) could dramatically improve my skills and make everything a lot more fun. But I can't help but feel that this is a foolish thing to hope for. If I'm bad at music now, why would that change if I got a shiny, expensive tool? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\tIf I was truly good at it, could I not compose masterpieces with nothing but a pen and paper? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\tAnd so, I find myself in a dead end of doubt.\n<br>To elaborate, I imagine that playing a keyboard would let me absorb music theory concepts (namely a feel for harmony) intuitively by playing existing songs (which includes learning them), and noodling around, performing rapid experimentation at a rate 10000 times higher than possible by clicking in notes with a mou\n se.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t And \n playing an instrument seems like something that brings you really close to the music.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t That's a feeling I long for. I got a taste of it by my DAW that lets me play notes with my computer keyboard, and I had a blast with it (but of course I quickly ran into ghosting and range issues).</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t\n<br>But on the other hand, I've been dabbling with music for years now (I have over 500 unique projects on my laptop) and still don't have much to show for it. That sounds like a red flag signifying that there is no hope to me. I fear that my keyboard would end up a grand waste of money and space, since I lack the talent needed to operate it.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t\n<br>So my question is: is it realistic to hope for a dramatic skill improvement as a result of obtaining a keyboard, or am I a victim of capitalism foolishly hoping that buying something will fix my problems?</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t\n<br>Sorry that this got so long, but I felt like I needed to write it all down. Thanks for reading this if you did!</qco> </h3><br><br>"
