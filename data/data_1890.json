Teachers help with this because over time they acquire tons of dead easy songs, hard songs, and the whole gradient between.\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, teachers provide a shortcut to valuable knowledge, like \"the more you do it, the better you get\" or \"start simple and work your way up\" or \"remember to take breaks\".\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, teachers are like grocery stores. Sure, you could go farm-to-farm trying to get what you need, but it's much easier to go to one source that is experienced in getting you what you need.\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebuttal?</qco> </h3>"
