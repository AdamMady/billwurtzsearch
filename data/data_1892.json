It's like I forget how awesome the ideas felt to me when I came up with them. I've tried your strategy of just cateloging and recording every damn thing I think of, but I never end up going back to listen to them, and meanwhile I'm neck deepin something else that caught my attention, whether it's figuring out how the fuck math works, how the fuck computers work, how the fuck communication (e.g. talking politely, teaching) works, and also how the fuck the world works. </qco></h3>"
