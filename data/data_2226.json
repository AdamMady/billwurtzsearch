What chord comes before it, what comes after? What notes are the other instruments/singer playing at the same time you're playing your chord (the bass player has the power to change a lot of chords if he/she wants to and the \"melody instrument\" can add extensions). It doesn't really matter what name you give the chord, but if you're writing a piece of sheet music or something..
