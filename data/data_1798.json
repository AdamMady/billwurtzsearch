That actually makes me feel a lot better about things. Thank you. Now, here's another thing, do you ever feel like something you're trying to do gets \"lost in translation/adaption\"? Example: I have this amazing short story. One of the best things I've written thus far. There's this playwright competition thing I'm doing for school (two actually). I had this great idea: \"Hey, I'm going to turn that short story of mine into a stage play\" So, I start writing. And ew. In my head the idea worked so well, but on paper it's just not good. It loses all the stuff that made the original so fucking good. It made me kinda resent the story and avoid working on the script but the deadline is rearing it's godawful head and I'm going to have to finish it even though i don't like it and it just isn't what I wish it was. Oh, another thing I hate ab\n out it. \n I'm expected to write a good play but they (the judges i guess) put so many restrictions on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
