I obviously know that mistakes and so on make the song better. Quantization ruins the groove and mistakes enhance the finished artwork to a level a \"perfect\" song never could achieve. Like the missing arms of the venus of milow. Obviously a mistake, but makes the statue sooo much better Anyway, I want to reformulate the question a bit, because this is not exactly what I was trying to ask. It's not that the song has to be perfect but I have to be satisified 100% with my Song to release it. But you probably know that we artist get sick of our songs bc we listen to it so much. So my question is: Are you always 100% satisified and a fan of your stuff at the time of release or in production? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or do you think \"ahh it sounds bad but I release it anyways\" and if so, how can you release stuff that you aren't 100% satisfied with?
