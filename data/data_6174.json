I used 5-digit groups for the first hundred, but after that I found it was better to use variable-length groups -- easier to make up a story around them, harder to mix up the order, and so on.\n<br>\n<br>What's weird if I memorized them in my native language, which is not English, and it's really hard for me to recite the decimals in English. I have to pronounce them in my native language and translate the digits into English on the fly, which is hard to do at the same time. I memorized the sounds of the numbers, not the numbers themselves. I never decided to do that, it's just how I naturally did it. I wonder if other people memorized the shapes instead, and would have an easier time saying them in a different language by just visualizing the numbers instead of having to pronounce them internally.\n<br>\n<br>I'm not a musician but I'm curious as to how you learn a song. Probably you \n don't ju\n st recall the specific notes or chords, but some higher-order pattern? Is this something you can explain in simple words?</qco> </h3>"
