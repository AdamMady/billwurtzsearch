But what I do is I compare the note to a pre-selected list of songs, and I can tell the note's pitch by what song it matches. It's not always snap-instant, but I can usually get at least a half-step around the true note.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t And these songs are ones I have only discovered very recently.
