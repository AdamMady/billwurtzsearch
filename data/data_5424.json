But my question is, does every melody fit into some sort of mode?</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like, someone who doesn't know modes could write something in C major that's mostly diatonic, but with a #F and then technically it's lydian. Does every melody fit diatonically to a mode? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kind of hope not because that feels very restricting (I like a good chromatic melody) but I thought I'd ask my go-to 24/7 music tutor. Anyways, have a good day.</qco> </h3>"
