I do this partially because I like the position of the black keys in Cmin (makes for good\"slideability\"), but also because I just feel more comfortable playing in that key. I feel like I've gotten more used to playing there that I can go to the moon and back easier than in other keys. Do you think I should probably do the smart thing and just get better and more comfortable going wild in all 12 keys, or should I just stick to what's easiest and what I'm best at?&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
