You often answer 'movement' to the 'what is life question' and I often answer with 'change' because I think life is a river, which is moving, and so changing. Or it's like two things going all over the place and bumping into each other (change&amp;movement). To me, this seems like almost the same answer, but you can have change without movement but NOT movement without change. Wondering what you think about the relationship between those two concepts.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
