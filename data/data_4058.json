This is what I was getting at (more fleshed out). The dom9 chord (e.g. G9: G-B-D-F-A) is probably the most consonant</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; combination of 5 notes that we have in the 12-note scale. In lots of compositions, chords are more frequently thought of in 4 voices instead of 5 (thank u bach chorales), so we frequently encounter chords that are 4 out of the 5 notes of a dominant 9 chord. Using the G chord, we have G7 = G9 no9, Gadd9 = G9 no7, Dm6 = B hdim7 = G9 no1, and I sometimes also see G9 approximated in 4 voices by leaving out the 5th. These four are all pretty common chords, all quite consonant. But the 5th 4-pitch chord coming from the dom9 that should be just as consonant as the other 4 is G9 no3 = {D,F,G,A} = d minor add4.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The frequency I see minor add4 chords in leadsheets and such is basically zero compared to the other 4 chords that are dom9 chords omitting 1 of the 5 notes.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you feel there is a good reason for this?</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the the minor add4 chord lacking something musically that makes it rare compared to the other chords mentioned, even though it should \"\"theoretically\"\" sound just as reasonable?&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
