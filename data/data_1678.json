Someone in the comments said no, it's clearly in Ab major and goes ii &gt; vi &gt; V &gt; IV. Someone else said no, it's in F minor and goes iv &gt; i &gt; VII &gt; VI. It was all a bit silly and it made me wonder if I should just analyze all songs in a major key even if they're minor or another mode. E.g. it seems a lot easier to just remember that vi &gt; IV sounds cool rather than remembering both vi &gt; IV and i &gt; VI since they are the same notes. Do you see any downsides in only thinking about chords from an \"ionian perspective\"? (this might be a cool math rock band name) Or are there benefits in calling the vi chord the i chord if the song is in a minor key?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
