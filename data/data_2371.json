He was trying to trade some dust for grass and then he had to fight aliens to get his dust back. But then the alien turned everything pink, and Triangle Boy got.. powers? The power of sleeping and Triangles. Then he flew into the sky, and ate the aliens ship. After that, some song called \"long long long journey\" played. It was really cool, and even had triangle boy in it! And then, he finally got to trade his dust for grass, and turn it into more grass. What did you think of the movie?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
