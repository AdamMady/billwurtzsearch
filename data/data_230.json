This is usually the answer i give when i wouldn't have originally thought 'yes', but then after thinking about it for a moment, i realize, for the first time, that i do actually agree with the idea posed in the question. which in most cases would be something new to me at that moment. A small percentage of the use-cases for that answer are also because i just think that answer fits well with the question. sometimes it leaves room for the reader to think about it a little more, considering the implications of both a 'no' and a 'yes' answer, and the transition from one to the other. i find that answer to have a lot of different nuances depending on the question, so that's why i think i get so much mileage out of it\n\n<br><br>"
