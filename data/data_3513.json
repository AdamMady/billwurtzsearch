Ive actually found that recording podcast has helped me have better conversations overall. Reminded me of you, by recording what you do, you probably start doing it outside of recording too in automatic. I am starting to have good-content quality conversations. I am just anxious about recording an episode with someone and having to tell them it doesnt fit my format and wont be released. (which ive done several times). its just easier to make that decision when its a just-me episode. I dont want people to make conclusions on their own capabilities as a guest if i decide its not on-format.&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
