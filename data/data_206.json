    "html": "<h3> <dco>7.22.24&nbsp; \n3:37 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Hey, my question basically could be summarized as \"how did you develop yourself as a musician?\" (out of curiosity), and also, maybe, \"how do you 'understand/(feel about)' music?\", but unsure about that last one. Also, sorry if I ask too much and feel free to omit [not answer everything].  Relatively recently, I got more curious than I've ever been about music. And I found on the internet that you're self-taught and (from what I understand) that you don't really like music theory, and say that music can't really be described like that [sorry if I oversimplfy or misunderstand some stuff]. Which sounds kinda like the approach I would want to take to understand music better and/or maybe even write some of my own music later on.  I think what sparkled my curiosity in music, was that some particular songs made me feel specific feelings, some songs being especially intense in that (a large amount of feeling ignited) [How did you get into music? (curiosity)].</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, that made me curious why those songs in particular and how do they make me feel such intense feelings [Do you have songs that made you experience similar things? Do you have the means (what sort of means? how did you get those means?) to explain that, or did you just accept the feelings without questioning them? (Other?)]. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that the two most important things in a song to me are \"feeling\" and \"story\". \"Story\" isn't necessarily lyrics;&nbsp;it could be fully instrumental song, it just may feel like the melody is still telling a story. And \"feeling\" is 'simply' the fact that melody evokes particular feelings. So, if I were to compose music, I feel like I would want to have these 2 [Do you have \"similar\" ideas about music, that you possibly apply to composing your own pieces of music?] </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that I know like nothing about music, and when I'm behind the keyboard I basically can do only hit random keys, </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and actually they sometimes provide some melodies(, etc) that sound somewhat adequate, and I actually made one into somewhat of a song. So, while this random hitting could provide some ideas, and maybe it is the way to discover music vocabulary, I am completely clueless as to how to transfer the feeling and the story with some sort of intent. And maybe my story/feeling idea isn't even the right approach to making music after all. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[How did you start to compose music, and how did that change over time?] </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, while I am at it (at asking bajilion questions): 1. How did you learn to sing while being self-taught? I would be curious to learn how to sing (at least a bit, for the sake of understanding music), but this one feels by far the scariest, as to not pick up bad habits, improper techniques, and not injure throat. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. How did you develop your \"ear\"? In particular, how was the \"the high class stuff\" video made? The transcription of pitches of the speaking voice and the insane rhythms in it (weird rests (\"offbeat\"?), weird durations, triplets, quintuplets). </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This text is so large so that I have to thank you just for reading it, and also thanks for answering on top of that.</qco> </h3>"

I will say I hit that wall in writing today and tried that idea of making it bad on purpose, and it literally completely worked and propelled the whole thing forward into the right direction. I think the idea works because fundamentally good songs play, like play around, and trying something bad to throw a wrench in the whole thing is sometimes the right chaos and the order / clean up that follows feels so good.
