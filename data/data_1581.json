So my mind is split making sure I got the left hand right and then the right hand right (and with the memorized finger positions).</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does your keyboard have sound? make sure you are checking how these things sound because what you are describing sounds frightful<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let's say I have a less than ideal memorized way of placing my fingers on the notes because that's how i first came upon them, then I would just be repeating my mistake everytime simply because thats how i memorized the 2 blocks. But on the other hand if my \"mental check list\" goes note by note from the bottom up, then my hands might fix the mistake the second time i play by going \"ah, that makes more sense how my fingers landed on the notes this time around\" and instead of memorizing how to place my hand on them, my hands start learning finger placement instinct in a sense, and i have more mental space to do/think other things. I always thought it was easier to memorize both blocks because, lets say for the second 8 note chord I could memorize Gb7</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just for some perspective, i've already mentioned that i think  you are living in a completely alternate universe from me, and that might be ok, but, generally if I see Gb7 on the page, the basic go-to way i would play this (not taking any context into account), and if i am the only instrument (not a band) i would play 1 note in the left hand and 2 notes in the right hand. Left hand is bass note Gb (let's say the 92.5hz one) and the right hand is playing Bb and E (233 and 330). depending on context and what key the song is in etc etc you might need a little more (maybe add Db in between) but that voicing would pretty much be the standard for me. If i'm in a band and there is already a bass player there, do the same thing but skip the bass note<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on left hand and a Bbadd9 on the right hand, both on root position. But I am coming to the realization that seeing them this way may intelectualize the process too much and make me think&nbsp;&nbsp;of music in more math/pattern terms rather than feeling the music. As for the puzzle part, if i just play the right notes and not worry about which hand does which, the hands slowly start gaining instinct of how to play what. And everytime you play them, you're figuring out the finger-placement puzzle again, or atleast starting to make the connection of both hands working as one as opposed to LH does x, RH does&nbsp;&nbsp;y. Another advantage I believe is that when changes need to be made to the voicing they are made to the whole at the same time, and rebalancing voices in the other hand to fit the change becomes easier. Because you don't need to relearn both blocks again and/or how they differ from the previous version of the chord, you just need to solve a new puzzle when playing.Mentally it feels kind of like the first time I started seeing the harmonies in classical music as opposed to just learning the notes and the order they come in at. Way easier to play bach's prelude 1 if you know the chords that are being arpeggiated rather than learning/reading each note by itself as it comes. I thin I am slowly unhindering myself of the limitations of the way I learned to play music as a kid. It just always seemed so intimidating to me seeing people improv 2 handed chords</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think you are overestimating the existence of 2 handed chords. if you are using 2 hands for a chord, your hands should either be very very close (like in the same range) and hopefully not playing more than about 6 notes max (beyond that it just gets crazy dense ... if you add more notes, they should be on the same notes you're already playing. which means other instruments have to play them) OR, you have a chord with your right hand and 1 note in the bass range. but only do this if you have absolutely no other bass player in your group<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over changes and I thin perhaps they weren't thining of them as 2 separate blocks one for each hand, but as one whole thing. The other advantage to not seeing it as 2 hands I believe is that it's easy to say, well that chord needs one less note, and just play the chord and let the fingers figure out who plays who, as opposed to trying to keep balance or saying \"well, there was 4 and 4, now theres 4 and 3, i should probably take one out of the left hand too to make it balanced\" when the balance perhaps doesn't lie in number of notes in each hand but simply what the music needs, which might not always makes sense in the pattern/balance-seeking frame of mind. I hope it makes more sense or atleast shows what I'm thinking better.\n<br>\n<br>Tl;dr, \"Gb7 on left hand, Bbadd9 on right hand\" turns into G-Bb-D-F-Bb-C-D-F.</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oh you meant Gmin7. the example i gave before was for Gb7. --- Gb7 actually means Gb dominant 7<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First one might make more sense for writing down/analyzing, second might be more instinctive and wont rely on having to make sense of each hand as an individual chord. Like, on the example of the first chord F-Ab-C-Eb-G-Bb-Eb-G, itd be hard to categorize G-Bb-Eb-G as a recognizable chord, perhaps some sort of Eb in first inversion with a doubled 3rd on the top but I want to let my ears do the listening, my fingers the playing and my mind the enjoying instead of intelectualizing it. It may seem I'm saying the newer way im doing it is better but I think maybe it just complements something that's been lacking in my approach to music thus far and a balance must be found as opposed to committing to one way or the other. I find the mind of a piano harmony improvizer intriguing and I hope this new approach makes it less convoluted in my head. It just seems like itll be way easier to improvize when im not trying to first make two independent hand voicings and placing them together as opposed to thining of a big voicing spread through all my fingers (and let them do the chosing of which plays what note as opposed to summoning up some finger positions from the catalogue since my catalogue may be too limited atm. It feels like when playing with this new frame of mind, it's easier to try new stuff and let the music speak to me.

I think its the Gmin7 with a \"Bb add9\" on top. so really a Gmin7 add11 with doubled 5th and 7th,&nbsp;&nbsp;but revisitting it it should be a Bb something, as so the F something should really be a Ab something. and yes i do agree these are separate universes, but i wont let that excuse me from doing things in a perceivably wrong way(regardless of how thick i want my supersaws to sound). I get too sidetracked for beefiness that I may be overdoing the voicings and cluttering the arrangement (and missing the tonal center). Highly truly appreciate you taking your time to go over my rant and bring obje\n ctivity.\n &nbsp;&nbsp;Now I have another point of view(and way more experienced) on my voicing approach or atleast cataloguing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it feels like im working on a vacuum but im super grateful and lucky to be able to bounce these things with a way more experienced skillster to atleast have a sense of where the needle might be pointing as opposed to letting my subjectivenes or missfocus from sidetracking me into a least-ideal place. I hope my follow up made more sense and had less mistakes at essential points. . So the 2 chord thing i was describing once i take your advice into consideration would be something like Ab bass (the F at the bottom was really unnecesary, its really some sort of Ab) with right hand doing g-bb-eb, and then going to G bass with f-g-bb-d on right hand. \n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you chose what to leave out when using many tensions on chords?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or it's a feel-along excercise with the theory behind the played voicings being an afterthought to analyze what was done? Upon\n  yet ano\n ther revision my last version would be Ab (207.65) and on right hand g(392)-bb-c=eb which would translate to Abmaj7add9, and then for second chord Bb on bass (233) and then on right hand f(349)-bb-c-d. which would be a Bbadd9. Does it sound like a more balanced voicing?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did have a weird keys patch where i was jamming with it but going to a normal keyboard sound makes it clearer to hear what im doing instead of letting the reverb disguise the sound.

The thing is, when moving from first set of 8 to second set of 8, the checklist becomes twice as long when trying to make the change fast, since I have to run the checklist of 2 4 note chords as opposed to a big one. So my mind is split making sure I got the left hand right and then the right hand right (and with the memorized finger positions).</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does your keyboard have sound? make sure you are checking how these things sound because what you are describing sounds frightful<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let's say I have a less than ideal memorized way of placing my fingers on the notes because that's how i first came upon them, then I would just be repeating my mistake everytime simply because thats how i memorized the 2 blocks. But on the other hand if my \"mental check list\" goes note by note from the bottom up, then my hands might fix the mistake the second time i play by going \"ah, that makes more sense how my fingers landed on the notes this time around\" and instead of memorizing how to place my hand on them, my hands start learning finger placement instinct in a sense, and i have more mental space to do/think other things. I always thought it was easier to memorize both blocks because, lets say for the second 8 note chord I could memorize Gb7</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just for some perspective, i've already mentioned that i think  you are living in a completely alternate universe from me, and that might be ok, but, generally if I see Gb7 on the page, the basic go-to way i would play this (not taking any context into account), and if i am the only instrument (not a band) i would play 1 note in the left hand and 2 notes in the right hand. Left hand is bass note Gb (let's say the 92.5hz one) and the right hand is playing Bb and E (233 and 330). depending on context and what key the song is in etc etc you might need a little more (maybe add Db in between) but that voicing would pretty much be the standard for me. If i'm in a band and there is already a bass player there, do the same thing but skip the bass note<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on left hand and a Bbadd9 on the right hand, both on root position. But I am coming to the realization that seeing them this way may intelectualize the process too much and make me think&nbsp;&nbsp;of music in more math/pattern terms rather than feeling the music. As for the puzzle part, if i just play the right notes and not worry about which hand does which, the hands slowly start gaining instinct of how to play what. And everytime you play them, you're figuring out the finger-placement puzzle again, or atleast starting to make the connection of both hands working as one as opposed to LH does x, RH does&nbsp;&nbsp;y. Another advantage I believe is that when changes need to be made to the voicing they are made to the whole at the same time, and rebalancing voices in the other hand to fit the change becomes easier. Because you don't need to relearn both blocks again and/or how they differ from the previous version of the chord, you just need to solve a new puzzle when playing.Mentally it feels kind of like the first time I started seeing the harmonies in classical music as opposed to just learning the notes and the order they come in at. Way easier to play bach's prelude 1 if you know the chords that are being arpeggiated rather than learning/reading each note by itself as it comes. I thin I am slowly unhindering myself of the limitations of the way I learned to play music as a kid. It just always seemed so intimidating to me seeing people improv 2 handed chords</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think you are overestimating the existence of 2 handed chords. if you are using 2 hands for a chord, your hands should either be very very close (like in the same range) and hopefully not playing more than about 6 notes max (beyond that it just gets crazy dense ... if you add more notes, they should be on the same notes you're already playing. which means other instruments have to play them) OR, you have a chord with your right hand and 1 note in the bass range. but only do this if you have absolutely no other bass player in your group<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over changes and I thin perhaps they weren't thining of them as 2 separate blocks one for each hand, but as one whole thing. The other advantage to not seeing it as 2 hands I believe is that it's easy to say, well that chord needs one less note, and just play the chord and let the fingers figure out who plays who, as opposed to trying to keep balance or saying \"well, there was 4 and 4, now theres 4 and 3, i should probably take one out of the left hand too to make it balanced\" when the balance perhaps doesn't lie in number of notes in each hand but simply what the music needs, which might not always makes sense in the pattern/balance-seeking frame of mind. I hope it makes more sense or atleast shows what I'm thinking better.\n<br>\n<br>Tl;dr, \"Gb7 on left hand, Bbadd9 on right hand\" turns into G-Bb-D-F-Bb-C-D-F.</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oh you meant Gmin7. the example i gave before was for Gb7. --- Gb7 actually means Gb dominant 7<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First one might make more sense for writing down/analyzing, second might be more instinctive and wont rely on having to make sense of each hand as an individual chord. Like, on the example of the first chord F-Ab-C-Eb-G-Bb-Eb-G, itd be hard to categorize G-Bb-Eb-G as a recognizable chord, perhaps some sort of Eb in first inversion with a doubled 3rd on the top but I want to let my ears do the listening, my fingers the playing and my mind the enjoying instead of intelectualizing it. It may seem I'm saying the newer way im doing it is better but I think maybe it just complements something that's been lacking in my approach to music thus far and a balance must be found as opposed to committing to one way or the other. I find the mind of a piano harmony improvizer intriguing and I hope this new approach makes it less convoluted in my head. It just seems like itll be way easier to improvize when im not trying to first make two independent hand voicings and placing them together as opposed to thining of a big voicing spread through all my fingers (and let them do the chosing of which plays what note as opposed to summoning up some finger positions from the catalogue since my catalogue may be too limited atm. It feels like when playing with this new frame of mind, it's easier to try new stuff and let the music speak to me. How do you approach memorizing/improvizing voicings when you are writing/arranging/playing?&nbsp;</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i've really never memorized anything of that sort. most of the learning i've ever done with regard to keyboard / chords / fingering, etc, has been a result of spending a very very long time with the keyboard in a deep state of experimental enjoyment. also i will mention again that this default idea that both hands are supposed to play a chord seems all wrong. the only scenario really where i think that would be a good idea is if you had 2 keyboards and you were playing them right in the same range and at least some of the notes are the same. the magic range where harmony/chords work is generally very small (within about 1 octave range). when you spread out, at least on the low side, you'll want single notes only (for bass range). and if you are talking about spreading way up higher, still i think you are going to find that this \"each hand plays a chord\" idea is just not sound. at least i think that's what you find when you start really paying attention to the sound\n<br><br><h3> \n</h3></quoteaco></quotequestion>",

I dont know if that makes more or less sense. And i did call Gb7 something wrong. I think its the Gmin7 with a \"Bb add9\" on top. so really a Gmin7 add11 with doubled 5th and 7th,&nbsp;&nbsp;but revisitting it it should be a Bb something, as so the F something should really be a Ab something. and yes i do agree these are separate universes, but i wont let that excuse me from doing things in a perceivably wrong way(regardless of how thick i want my supersaws to sound). I get too sidetracked for beefiness that I may be overdoing the voicings and cluttering the arrangement (and missing the tonal center). Highly truly appreciate you taking your time to go over my rant and bring obje\n ctivity.\n &nbsp;&nbsp;Now I have another point of view(and way more experienced) on my voicing approach or atleast cataloguing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it feels like im working on a vacuum but im super grateful and lucky to be able to bounce these things with a way more experienced skillster to atleast have a sense of where the needle might be pointing as opposed to letting my subjectivenes or missfocus from sidetracking me into a least-ideal place. I hope my follow up made more sense and had less mistakes at essential points. . So the 2 chord thing i was describing once i take your advice into consideration would be something like Ab bass (the F at the bottom was really unnecesary, its really some sort of Ab) with right hand doing g-bb-eb, and then going to G bass with f-g-bb-d on right hand. \n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you chose what to leave out when using many tensions on chords?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or it's a feel-along excercise with the theory behind the played voicings being an afterthought to analyze what was done? Upon\n  yet ano\n ther revision my last version would be Ab (207.65) and on right hand g(392)-bb-c=eb which would translate to Abmaj7add9, and then for second chord Bb on bass (233) and then on right hand f(349)-bb-c-d. which would be a Bbadd9. Does it sound like a more balanced voicing?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did have a weird keys patch where i was jamming with it but going to a normal keyboard sound makes it clearer to hear what im doing instead of letting the reverb disguise the sound. It seems like by your description your instinct would be to go for bass on left and guide tones (3rd and 7th) on right and then alter from there?&nbsp;\n</qco></h3>",
