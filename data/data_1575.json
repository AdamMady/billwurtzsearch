For some reason when I do go that low I usually double that octave but through listening to these clear examples i can see how it can actually unbeef the lowest note.\n</qco></h3>      actually doubling a bass octave is usually pretty safe, and doesn't really change the harmonic information much. anything else besides an octave, will be mud town. a general rule of thumb can be discovered .... whatever the lowest single note is that doesn't sound muddy, (let's say it's the lowest C on a 5-string bass, which is about like 32hz or something), i think you'll find that you can octave double that just fine without mud. and the next thing you'll find is that the lowest you can really go safely with a 5th interval is right there in the next octave: C64 and G98 will work fine together, and pack seemingly the same *girth* as the low C. and just the same, a fourth at G98 and C131, will be about the lowest you can take a perfect 4th before it starts to turn to mud. just the same, for the major third, the lower limit will be right here at C131 and E165. following just the same after that, the lowest limit for the minor third will appear to be right there around E165 and G196. none of this is a hard set in stone lower interval limit (these are called LILs in some social circles) but you can notice that they are easily a function of the harmonic series, which is what happens when you take a note and keep doubling the frequency. that low C (32), then C64, then G98, then C131, then E165, G196, the next one is actually a weird half flat 7th, and so on etc etc. interesting phenomenon but the point is that the lower you go, the more simple the interval has to be or else it will turn to mud, and then if you go too low then only 5ths will work and then if you go even lower only single notes will work, and if you go below like low B or maybe A? even single notes turn to mud. i personally think it's more like B. the lowest note on an acoustic piano is A and i really can't hear a note there, it sounds like a noteless grind<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because if the patch im playing with say has any vibrato, tremolo, or even chorusing or other dsp, by doubling the octave you wouldn't necessarily get that extra punch at the desired frequencies because there'd be way more noise (noise as in many more frequencies besides the fundamental, not really all-frequencies-noise) because of the nature of timbre and that could muddy up the low end.\n</qco></h3>      you'd be fine if you played them both at the exact same time. the vibratos should be syncronized<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just realized my 61key midi keyboard doesnt go below c(65).\n</qco></h3>      usually those ones have octave switchers<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When trying out the stuff you mentioned i put it an octave down and will be able to jam at a happier harmonic space.\n</qco></h3>      1 octave down is a friendly place to be on a 61 key keyboard if you are playing by yourself and you want to take care of the bass. super cool if you get a bass split, then you can play with just a drummer and a singer and it's almost like you've completed the band. takes some practice but if you throw yourself into a situation where you have to do that, you'll sprout wings! like jumping off a cliff. very fun<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going with your Ab 52 example going with chord starting at Bb233, I like doing Bb C Eb G \n</qco></h3>      yep, i believe that's the photo in the dictionary you should see next to Abmaj9<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and trying the second as u suggested with Bb 58 and C D F starting at middle c. Do you think you stray away from also playing Bb right below middle c wit\n h your r\n ight hand because of the most reasonable note to fit in a happy harmonic place within the context of the current notes is the root and its already in the bass?\n</qco></h3>      a fun secret of chords and chord playing is leaving out the bass note. sometimes if you want that extra thickness, fine you can have it, but i actually find when i'm playing by myself and i am covering the chord and the bass, i play the bass note in the right hand almost 0% of the time. actually much easier the think that way. there are a few cases where i do use it. and now that i think about it, most of those cases where i do use it are cases where there are still only 3 notes in the right hand<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying to reason out when 3 notes might do a better work than 4 (again fighting against my now aware bias towards more=better). \n\n</qco></h3>      3 notes in the mid range, plus a bass note, is super great. 4 is super cool too. if we were to start listening to every song on the planet in random order, and go through and check how many notes are in each chord, in the mid and bass range, i'm pretty sure we would find that by far the most common case is 3 or 4 notes in the mid range, and 1 in the bass. that even includes the melody<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought i might add some more chords to those 2 to practice and get your thoughts with a bigger context so this is what i came up with to get a complete harmonic idea. https://imgur.com/Dx5oEck  \n</qco></h3>      super classic. reminds me essentially of \"you are everything and everything is you\" and hundreds of others. this means you're in the key of Eb by the way. start playing melodies in Eb and you'll see that i mean. songs with these chords always have the melody in Eb<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, i'm happy with all but my first chord, the thing about the first chord is that I have an alternative way, by removing the Bb.\n</qco></h3>      yep<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like both but this is when my indecisiveness/whelm for possibilities/overthinking starts.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</qco></h3>      well remember, you don't even have a melody yet. like you're making a movie, you've designed the entire set, and now you are worring about which flowers to use, but you haven't even looked at the script yet. let's not get ahead of ourselves. What's the scene about! only then will it matter which direction to point that little flower<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like the 4 notes on right hand as its the first measure and maybe it reinforces the one, but at the same time i think Bb could be better off not there for several contexts. To have a clear one, lets say we're singing never gonna give you up's f\n irst ver\n se.\n</qco></h3>      oh that's right, it's those chords<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like Bb but no C. these would be the 3 variations im deciding between: https://imgur.com/3gKUMvN.</qco></h3>      ah, 3 more dictionary-like photos. of Abmaj9, Abmaj7, and Eb/Ab (\"Eb over Ab\")<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n I think it would make more sense to remove the Bb and keep C on the first chord and leave the 4 chords like this: https://imgur.com/mGJT4lj\n</qco></h3>      yeah, for that first chord it just depends how dense you wanna make it. which in this case will partially depend on what textures you have. but in general, the Abmaj7 will sound 'dreamy/longing', the Eb/Ab will sound more \"shiny\", and the Abmaj9 will of course be a hybrid of the two situations<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but tbh i find it hard to decide mostly because of indecisiveness and fomo on the other possibilities.\n</qco></h3>      yeah, and it's important to remember we're splitting hairs here before the actors have even arrived, so to speak<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Would those last voicings make the most sense to you?\n</qco></h3>      seems totally cool to me, but no one will know until someone has read the script. i.e. knows the melody and the lyrics<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really like the other 2 voicings but I'm not 100% sure of my choice of voicing it as Cmin with Ab bass (to make a Abmaj7) I was wondering to what degree would context have to change for those 3 to be usable or the most optimal for specific contextual situations in your opinion? Is my choice the most appropriate for a Rickroll reharm/voicing?\n</qco></h3>      i think in the rickroll song you'll need that dreamy C note under there and the Bb would be optional in terms of shine but most likely i think it would be Abmaj7. i'd bet on that being what they used. specifically i'd venture to wager that there is a good chance the G note was only in the vocal. (this is pending transpositions of course) <h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br>I hope im not misusing/abusing the questions page. Highly appreciate your input and you taking your time.</qco> </h3>      also this is a good time to mention if you haven't tried this, do this same sequence but keep the bass on Ab for your second chord also. like Bb over Ab for the second chord. this would be exactly the \"you are everything and everything is you\", i think you'll recognize this cliche tear-jerking ballad sequence, which seems to have originated in the 70s (i think?) but can be heard well throughout the 80s and 90s and even today. especially in those sappy 'i miss you dearly' sort of feels. i think you'll recognize what i mean right away\n<br><br>"
