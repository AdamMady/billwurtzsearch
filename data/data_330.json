If i throw a stone into the water, does it ripple sinusoidally?

I saw an argument that it is used because its derivative is also siney but im not sure if thats it.

I know that it represents the movement of a circle, but does it mean that nature is naturally circular? </qco></h3>      circles are natural, i'll give you that<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thats why when translated into one dimension we see sines?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>      that seems solid, except i think you'd still have to call it 2 dimensions. but it's just perpendicular straight dimensions instead of the radial thing\n\n<br><br>"
