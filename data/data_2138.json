In fact, such machines are specifically and carefully programmed to eliminate randomness in results. They do this by following rules and relying on algorithms when they compute.\"\n<br>\n<br>You can program a machine to generate what can be called \"random\" numbers, but the machine is always at the mercy of its programming. \"On a completely det\n erminist\n ic machine you can't generate anything you could really call a random sequence of numbers,\" says Ward, \"because the machine is following the same algorithm to generate them. Typically, that means it starts with a common 'seed' number and then follows a pattern.\" The results may be sufficiently complex to make the pattern difficult to identify, but because it is ruled by a carefully defined and consistently repeated algorithm, the numbers it produces are not truly random. \"They are what we call 'pseudo-random' numbers,\" Ward says.\n<br>\n<br>- MIT School of Engineering\n<br>\n<br>How do you feel about this? Will you stay with your stance of preferring computers to eliminate accidental reasoning or have you been influenced to believe that the machine can never trump human creativity&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
