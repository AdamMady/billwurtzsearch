The gods existence arises from the shared agreement that they exist. Through the plecebo effect, actions taken by the Gods become real to those with faith. Once those who beleive reach critical mass, the God begins to grow powerful. If a human can fit the description of the deity, and convince the faithful he has mantled it. That human now has the power to control the plecebo effect in their followers and can cause miracles like healing wounds that wouldnt heal. All by plecebo effect.
