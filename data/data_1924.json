It's to learn about how chord progressions work and which chords are the most frequently used - then do some dedicated ear training to recognise just those chords. This approach lets you very quickly develop a very useful ability level with this skill.\"\n<br>\n<br>Do you agree with this?\n<br></qco> </h3>      no. it's impossible for them to predict what music you are into. they might say 'these are the most common' but that's just from their perspective. everyone is living in a slightly different musical perspective, and has a slightly different comfort zone in terms of what music they are familiar with. i recommend learning the music you know. all music is good, and offers something to learn, and if you learn the music that made you like music, then everything is going to be fulfilling and meaningful<br><br>"
