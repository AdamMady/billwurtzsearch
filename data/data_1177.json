I'm doing that now because I am really bad at developing a melody but really good at coming up with a short melodic phrase and producing it to sound really fun and interesting. I think it is making me better somehow. I would also like to know how you learned to create longer songs that develop the melody and go to other places. It's hard for me to write stuff that doesn't \"end\" as quickly as it started.</qco> </h3><br><br>"

Some mud may be necessary to be cut via EQing (if used in the wrong areas), but it seems like a valid production technique when trying to add some density while maintaining the harmonic colour, if you will. </qco></h3>"
