I was really proud of myself but I think I'd have to thank you as well. That's just because I had one of your songs stuck in my head. This song was guess I'll have to listen to Bob Marley and it basicly told me to not worry about losing and just go for it. Seeing my first place, this song helped me a lot and I really hope I could use it more in life. It turns out that for me, you are mister wise man.</qco> </h3>"
