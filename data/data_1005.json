Doing a full recording/arrangement of a song is crazy enough, and if you don't know how the song goes you'll surely crumble. unless you are doing the type of arrangement that can be delivered in its final form in real time. It's like building a house. you have to know the specific plans of the house before building it, unless you have technology so advanced that the house can be built instantly, in which case yes you could definitely improvise the house\n\n<br><br>"
