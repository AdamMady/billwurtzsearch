And I also realised just now that that could apply to everything, and there's so many inaccessible layers to people's art or what they say that I'll never get, but it somehow is still able to touch me so deeply -or the opposite of that case where people want to let you in to help you understand them better - and layers are neither opaque nor transparent, there's a spectrum of openness and closed ness and it's pretty darn crazy I have to say</qco> </h3><br><br>"
