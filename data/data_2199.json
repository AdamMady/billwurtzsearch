I've also noticed this a lot in Prince's music (a lot of songs are self-referential or reference other songs, and there's certain little recurring rhythmic patterns that he uses, and certain ideas, like sexuality and spirituality, get revisited often). Dwayne Thomas Jr., a great bass player, takes it a step further and says that you should write down your own artistic vision and read it daily... So do you have your own, specific vision or 'conceptual continuity'? It doesn't have to be something that is clearly evident to fans, but just something in your own mind that your working towards, or kind of ties everything together for you?</qco> </h3>"
