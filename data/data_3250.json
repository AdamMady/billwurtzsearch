This worries me because the way I try to orient myself on the piano and guitar is by completely relying on memorization of the major scale. For the key of the song and/or the chord of the current measure, I visualize the shape given by the major scale that corresponds with that chord as numbers from 1-7 (along with 9,11,13 I guess, and also stuff like #5, b3, etc.), and so those numbers go on different keys/frets depending on the key/current chord. I wouldn't really be sure how I'd find my way around without this orientation. Is this a bad way to be going about it, </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if so, is there another method you would suggest that doesn't rely on the major scale?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
