I'm having trouble with dedicating myself to a discipline. I want to be able to choose one thing to pursue so I can have a place to grow and experiment within stable boundaries of a medium. However I always find myself torn. I will be really inspired by someone's X but then the process of making an X is sort of hard and boring. Then I will sort of feel like making a Y because the actual process is enjoyable, but then I'm not as inspired by the product of Ys and I feel like they don't have the inspiration capabilities of Xs. So I guess I am torn between pursuing what inspires me or doing the things I enjoy doing.. Or maybe not. Is this a trick? I really appreciate your time and I look forward to your next work!!!</qco> </h3>"
