So I'm familiar with how to write bass lines, and how the bass fits in with the overall harmony/rhythm of a tune... But I really wanna learn how to actually play the thing! Couple questions for you... Bass strings? What are the advantages/disadvantages of round wound vs flat wound strings? Do they sound different, or is just a different feel to them when playing? Also, what are the advantages/disadvantages of using heavy gauge strings vs light gauge strings (different sound or just different feel)? \n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more question, how important do you think it is to learn \"proper\" right-hand technique?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dabble on guitar a bit, so I think I can play the bass lines just fine.. but I want to make it sound good, which means more than just hitting the right note at the right time.

So, I have a seemingly endless supply of unfinished songs. Some of them are just little bits and pieces,&nbsp;&nbsp;some of them are nearly finished. But I can probably count on one hand the number of songs that I actually finished and recorded this year. I want to finish my songs. I want a nice base of full, completed, solid recordings. But I LOVE to write, much more than record. The ideas come faster than I can keep up with. I have multiple binders filled with sketched out charts and I don't how many rough audio demos. </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At what point do I need to say, ok stop writing, and finish what you've got? The issue is if I finish what I got that would mean going a very long time without writing, which is my favorite thing to do. I know it's different for me than you, because I don't have a fanbase awaiting my next move and deman\nding mor\ne content...
