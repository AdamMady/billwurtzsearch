I'm really heavily into one music artist, I was absolutely in love with them from the start, every song of theirs is gold, but I've just never had that with any other artist. I've listened to the Beatles, Queen, Elton John, etc, the legends, y'know? And while their stuff is good, it's not \"incredible\", like my first artist. Do I have expectations that are too high to compete with, or am I just lucky to have one artist I love so much, and give up on that ever happening again? I don't know why it gets me so worked up, but I figured it was worth asking you. Have a great day man, thanks</qco> </h3><br><br>"
