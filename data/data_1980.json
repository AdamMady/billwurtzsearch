She said that I became more awkward around her in person and she didn't want to ruin our relationship. I told her that I completely understood, but in all honesty, I hate myself for fucking up what we had together. I don't know why I became so awkward around her in person, and it really irritates me that I messed up with her, because I really did love her. I just didn't want to come off as clingy and weird in public. I'm kind of a shy and quiet person most of the time, and it takes me a while to warm up to someone and show them the real me. The only reason I didn't show her the love and affection that she deserved in public is because we only really see each other in school, and I didn't want anyone looking at me strangely. I get embarrassed and nervous easily, and I would have been panicking in my head if people looked and laughed at me while I was being affectionate t\n owards h\n er. The real issue here is that I still have feelings for her. I miss what we had together. I want to try again and be less awkward around her, but I feel like she'll turn me down this time because she might find someone else or I might fuck it up again. I don't know if I'll ever find a girl like her again. I feel like a hopeless piece of shit. What do I do to make myself feel better in a time like this?
