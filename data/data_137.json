(or do i need to get really good at sightreading / ear training?) i have been learning a few famous jazz standards but i'm not sure how i'm supposed to fit into the arrangement (when to play melody+chords, just melody, just chords, or a fill or solo). and i am decent at improvising but not sure how to make it sound jazzy. i have good understanding of harmony but usually don't have the skill to use it better than picking the right scales to play in. i'm learning that enclosures are useful for a jazzy sound but beyond that idk. i've heard about the altered scale but when i try it it just sounds off key. and am i supposed to be intuitively making harmonic substitutions? anyway do you have any advice for this situation?\n</qco> </h3>"
