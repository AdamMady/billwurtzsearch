I never really completed anything, because i never know what kind of medium do i want it to be in the end. has that ever happened to you? i have a lot of unfinished stuff laying around and i don't know where should i take them. I don't think i can do all of the stuff i like about music at the same time or can i? i never really found a passion as big as my passion for music, so i don't know if i should study to get that 'safe bet job'. got any advice for me?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
