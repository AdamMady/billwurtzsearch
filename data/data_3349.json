I guess what I am saying is I would ride with you through the pelican ages to the muskrat millennium, even if there are failures along the way. Even if there are other long periods of working on stuff other than content. Thanks for your work and for being you. I suspect lots of others feel the same but maybe you don't hear it because they don't want to bug you.
