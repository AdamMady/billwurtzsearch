Sure, I had all A's in school when I was younger, but that was due to my extreme perfectionism. at the time i thought that if i ever were to get a grade lower than A, i'd instantly fail in life and die.\n<br>People who are naturally intelligent remain being intelligent until they die. I was a \"smart\" kid back then, but now I'm average at best when it comes to intelligence. Some of my good friends even consider me extremely dumb. Am I just going through a \"dumb\" phase right now or have I always been dumb? I'm not sure..</qco> </h3>"
