I'm very stressed by my personal and education stuff and as a result I always feel tired, leaving me with no energy to focus on any instrument enough to actually improve. Usually I play whatever I feel like, mess around which can be fun but on non-polyphonic instruments gets boring quickly. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also I suspect that this way I'm discouraged from trying new things (because in the beginning they won't be fun, as I will fail at them over and over again), </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so I don't improve. As you see I'm kinda desperate, but that desperation isn't good enough of a fuel: I've attempted a serious approach, playing exercises from a book everyday but after a month the results were scarce, then I was forced to slow down and now I'm back at the beginning again. Back at pointless wankery too. I don't really believe I'm gonna make it \n anymore.\n  I'm thinking of quitting, and not just music. But that's just awful and I can't. I'm stuck, I don't know what to do. I've written folk tales, that didn't help. Maybe I should do something else, but at this point I've given too much to let go, and anyway if I'm this obsessed it's because I've had fun sometines, both listening, making and playing music.
