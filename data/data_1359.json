But it's a serious rut. because obviously listening to your music there's a whole other thing to it which i interpret as \"sparse-ness\". Meaning EVERY note can MATTER and hold serious weight leading into wherever it goes. I just suppose this anyway...But for Years i couldn't begin to understand the logic to it. Meanwhile, I plowed through a harmony book. learned about all these cool chords Outside of the major scale that relate to the major scale. and implement them as well as fun time signatures into my work in a way that was organic and good. but i still do the dumb chord thing. and so like a year ago to h\n opefully\n  evolve and understand why I needed to change I started transcribing pop songs i enjoyed, completely. even maracas for like one upbeat on a single measure. So I think my ear is getting better because of that. i mean it might be ridiculous. considering i'm sure even the players for \"running on empty\"-jackson browne were looking at Much simpler charts than what they actually played. but i insist on doing it. Anyway! So all this time passes in my development and i still feel like i'd immediately fall face first if i were let out in the real world because of the chord thing.</qco></h3>      yeah but it doesn't take long to get up. you'd be surprised how quickly, once you get out there<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t throughout all this time i would ask people \"how do i get out of this habit, how do i change?\" and they said almost every time \"...just do it? there's literally nothing stopping you.\" which seemed kind of asshole-ish. cuz it didn't really seem like advice. but lo and behold, last night i just \"did it\" and i can't explain how i \"did it\". i just did. the comping/voice leading was beautiful. it was honestly jus\n t a deci\n sion to do it.</qco></h3>      actually for that issue, at least the one you first mentioned, i definitely have some tangible hints, althought it seems like you've already been through it, based on your experience with song books, etc<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t and it kind of pisses me off because i could've done this THE WHOLE TIME!! but i literally can't explain it. it's ethereal. something fundamental in ME must've changed, or something. have you ever experienced anything like this?</qco></h3>      yes<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t not even just music but like being in a situation where \"there's a thing you want to do, you know what it is you gotta do, but something peculiarly vague in your bones is holding you back\"?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>      there are many things like that, sort of on the periphery. meanwhile there are the things that are front and center which are usually the subject of a flaming freight train. typically the biggest thing that holds me back on the most important stuff is the vastly infinite quantities of configurations, iterations, permutations, transliterative concatenations, .,.,.,,.,,.,\n<br><br>"
