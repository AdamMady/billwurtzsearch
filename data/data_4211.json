But if I look at how I'm feeling at the moment, It doesn't even feel right to make \"cool stuff\" it feels right to express my anger and fear and confusion.

And I'm attempting to be a good artist only to fall on my face. And I try to run away from these terrible feelings through video games and I even fail at that too. So I'm going through a pretty rough time. I don't even know what to do to help myself. But thank god it's nighttime. I can't stand the daytime because I'm surrounded by an environment that I hate and whenever I open my eyes I can see every single inch of it. I guess to comfort myself in these times I just go underneath my blankets and distance myself from the world and type to you. I just really want to feel better but I don't know how. Actually, I'd feel a lot b etter if I knew that I can succeed in the future without college and if I could be comfortable talking to my parents about my feelings. And i had a car so I can just leave my house and distance myself from everything I hate about this world. </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that's how I can truly be happy you know- being confident in the future and in yourself. I'm a bit hesitant to go all in and have a whole bunch of confidence that if I get better at art I'll be all set in life. I mean even if I'm wrong, I might as well try, right? It's better than just sitting here extremely afraid and sad. And i feel like I can learn a lot from it all- I mainly think that being good at art would be what makes me joyous and feel fulfilled in life because I love expressing myself. But if I can express myself in a more moving and beautiful way like through music and drawing, I think I'll have a blast. I can express myself in ways that have never been done before. But I have to learn first. I have to get really good and experienced to be able to express myself through song the way I want to.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So maybe I can type out my feelings in the meantime you know? And still continue to learn the mechanics but still express myself. And then when I get to the point where I'm super confident in my ability, I'll attempt to express my deep feelings through music.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Music is my main goal. I'm going to listen to some music before going to sleep. Bye.&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
