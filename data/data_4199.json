The thing is, I hear them now with some distance from those crippling perfectionism days where I perhaps didn't have the skillset to close the gap of my taste vs my skill, and I actually enjoy the attempts, but looking back on the process I wish I could do the same things without my mind getting in the way so I can become even better and not have it be such a passionate swirl of good and bad emotions. Ive been trying to figure out what short form of what I was trying to do back then would sound like because I thought I wanted to try something new on my revisiting of music, but hearing those old tracks make me want to try harder this time, and starting small. Im just thankful that I still have those tracks around to experience my journey even though back then I didn't feel \n like the\n y were good enough for me to share because of the expectations I thought people had of me being the guy returning home after going to a great music school.
