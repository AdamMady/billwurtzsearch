DON'T put it if it doesn't fit, but just keep searching from place to place until it really fits. doesn't count if it doesn't fit. with this technique you have to keep searching until it really fits, but it does still also have to go somewhere. but NOT anywhere, has to fit. but it has to go somewhere. i hope i have explained that properly. Also, you still have to do the song's core with fewer and more reliable basic instruments, but the decorations should be done on a 'what then when' basis rather than a 'when then what' basis. this is for production. writing usually goes the other way (when-what)\n<br><br>"
