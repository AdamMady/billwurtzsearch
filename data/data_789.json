I finished maybe 2-3 song because I \"abandoned\" them by finishing without thinking... I think I had luck for these 2-3 songs because I can't even develop my zillion ideas now. When I sit down and play guitar/piano I feel so much tired after 15min... I'm really desperate because I don't know what to do in order to get better.. please help me..</qco> </h3><br><br>"
