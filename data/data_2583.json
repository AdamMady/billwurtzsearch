And that trying to control it directly was impossible. The only thing I ever have had control of was the actual work. And for me, the corny truth at the center of it is that you should try to follow your impulse to GIVE something to people, not the impulse to get something from them. I try to tell myself to just shut the fuck up and work hard on something that I think is good and important and make it as good as I can and when I�m done with it, share it. Self-promotion should be the last step, not the first. But also I got super lucky and didn�t have to promote myself so I�m a bit of a privileged hypocrite � but like that self-branding shit is pretty gross and I just think like makes you feel icky and unsatisfied and I don�t think leads to happiness even when it works.\"</font> </h3>"
