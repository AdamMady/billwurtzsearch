Anyway, I am writing because I realized there is something wrong with me. I was talking to a friend about when we used to be super busy. I asked her how she was not miserable when she was overloaded not only with school and extracurriculars, but also heavy work shifts. She said \"I wasn't miserable. I was happy.\" Which made me realize how much I am not like that. I was miserable with half the schedule she had, and I continue to dread any amount of work that comes my way no matter how minuscule or easy. Except for I think I have a slightly smaller aversion when it comes to practicing music, though perhaps I would start to hate it if I pursued it as a serious education/career path. So basically what I am saying to you is: is there something wrong with me,</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should I look/wait for something I enjoy doing or\n </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should I just force myself to stick with something, and do you have any advice.</qco> </h3><br><br>"

I'm getting way more music done than I have been in months. But it feels *too* easy, if that makes sense. Like I could come up with a lot more creative and imaginative stuff if I wasn't just hypnotically pumping out the same stuff I'd always done.\n<br>\n<br>I guess my question is, is it possible for creative projects to be *too* easy to make?
