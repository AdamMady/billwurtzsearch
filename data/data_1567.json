It's nothing crazy or anything, but it's just that lately I haven't been enjoying video games quite as much so it's something else to do. I kind of have two questions, though. Firstly, I was wondering how you start writing a song.</qco></h3>      any way. this can be confusing until you are able to convince yourself that you statistically might do it everyway<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t For me, I've just hit a few piano notes at random until I heard a little melody that I liked just by coincidence and that's where I start,</qco></h3>      that's the way normal, sensible people do it, and i only discovered that trick very recently. it works fantastically well, i don't know why i was ever so afraid of it<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t but it sort of feels like I'm cheating because I imagine real musicians put a lot more thought into their music. </qco></h3>      music is everywhere. think as little or as much as you want. think a medium amount. go back and forth between the amounts and levels at which you think. there is music to be woven in and among any and all or none of those states<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\tMy other question is: do you think it's okay for songs to be short. I've never made anything longer than a minute. Maybe this was a weird question, I dunno. Thanks though.</qco> </h3>      \nif you want them to get on spotify, you're going to have to go through a lot of work to get them to accept it if it's under a minute. so i suppose at that point, the next question you would have to ask yourself is is it ok to not be on spotify\n<br><br>"
