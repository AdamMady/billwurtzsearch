So i had spent an entire day songwriting and i pretty much only made it through 2 stanzas. so the next day i had to kick myself and realize that this schedule is so ridiculous that i need to finish the song in the next 4 hours or it's pretty much game over. the 'sign' bit is the first bit to be written under that assumption. so in a way you can probably assume that this is the feeling of realizing i am going to have to steamroll the entire remainder of the songwriting process for this song. And i should clarify, steamrolling sometimes leads to fantastic growth, and i am thrilled with where the song ends up going, especially toward the end. and i don't think it would have ever gone like that, had the prior steamrolling not occured. it's a lesson that continues to play out again and again in the creative process, in the context of a world with limited time and resources\n<br><br>"
