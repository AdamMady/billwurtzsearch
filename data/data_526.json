It's description as \"special\" may be found in a less positive light than tonally suggested, or perhaps could be found rather as just a catchy verbally-'adjacent adjective' ..or perhaps entirely as just a magical item betrothed upon our main character that upon removal awakens their inner super-power of flight- I'm not entirely sure and I'd love to hear your thoughts on the line.</qco></h3>"
