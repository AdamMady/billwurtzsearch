The circle of fifths going up by sharps, right? Each key's tonic becomes the new sharp of the key two fifths further along in the circle. If you're in the key of B, go back two keys to A, then A♯&nbsp;is the last sharp of B. So what if the circle didn't end? What if I continued the circle? What if I wrote G♯? F double sharp, Bill. A black and unspeakable curse writ only by the dark lords of music, long before the Universe began. If I treasured dear life, I should have ventured no further. But I was already too far gone. One by one, I sharpened the sharps in the key signature. Every single one. And when I entered the key of G double sharp- It never stops. It's sharps forever, all the way into musical infinity. I can never return to sanity. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stared into the abyss, and it stared back into me. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm scared, Bill.
