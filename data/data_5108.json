I know he had an acoustic piano and a celesta on set, and played accordion sometimes, but can't find anything about the synth(s) he used for the flutey sound, or the Purple Panda segments. I would love to know because it highlights an intersection of 2 things I am highly interested in: Fred Rogers, and the history&nbsp;&amp; evolution of synth technology. But I can't find the answer and that really bugs me.</qco> </h3><a href=\"Schermafbeelding20230810om075205.png\" target=\"_blank\">this</a><a href=\"Schermafbeelding20230810om075149.png\" target=\"_blank\">this</a>"
