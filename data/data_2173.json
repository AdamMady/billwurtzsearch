But, I have a good solid base of stuff to go off of. But right now, I'm stuck in a MAJOR rut. Like, what do I do with all this music? The logical thing I think would be pairing music with videos, graphics, or some kind of visual aspect. But the thing is, I've never really felt the \"calling\" of being a video-maker. It's not really something I'm passionate about at all, in the same way I am about making music... and if im not passionate about it, why even do it? Even if I do decide to at least try making videos, I have no experience in it and wouldn't even know where to begin... Also, I feel like just making videos for the sake of pairing something up with my music isn't a good strategy since it would just be like forcing 2 things together instead of creating something with sound and visuals together that go hand and hand as pa\n rt of a\n whole. I have some songs that I think can stand alone, like more traditional verse/chorus stuff with vocals... but most of my stuff is like weird little instrumental pieces, like 10 seconds to a minute in length, which I don't think would make much sense on their own (when I wrote them I had certain images in mind, like this song reminds me of a mad scientists tinkering with a bunch of test-tubes and bubbling chemicals, this song sounds like you just got \"game over\" in a video game, this song sounds like you just had an idea and a light bulb went off over your head, this song sounds like your taking a walk and then something crazy jumps out in front of you, this one sounds like you tried to do something epic but then failed in an anticlimactic way at the very end, etc)... sorry for this long rambling text. But I just feel like I've been standing in front of the same hurdle for a very long time and have no ideas how to jump over it and it's disheartening. If you have any advi\n ce for m\n e, I'd really appreciate it. Like should I just force myself to try to learn how to make videos, and hope that over time I learn to enjoy it, get better at it, and find my own voice/style? Or should I seek alternate routes (which routes, I don't know) that don't involve me making videos?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>      well, if you really don't want to find any way to make videos but you feel like the material has to go with something visually (which i think is probably right) then you might consider finding someone else who wants to make the videos. or, another approach would be to find people that make videos and they are looking for music, and you could write music to their videos. neither of these options work for me because i am a control freak and i live under a rock. but because of that, i knew i had no choice but to learn how to make the videos myself. but if you don't want to do that you might try to explore some collaborative options\n<br><br>"
