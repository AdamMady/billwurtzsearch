I feel like I can only sequence maj/min chords with other maj/min chords in a progression. Mixing extended maj/min chords with plain old maj/min chords sounds too jarring, but *you* do it in a way that sounds like it fits. It's like plain major chords sound really bright and upbeat, but adding any extended chords after one clashes since most extended chords have a deeper feeling to them.</qco> </h3>"
