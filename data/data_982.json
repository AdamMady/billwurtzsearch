Then i researched a little bit about the history and found out that it was kind of a miracle font when it came out. no one had seen something with quite so much 'sparkle' to it. and then i started buying into the hype, especially after seeing what other fonts were around before that\n<br><br>"

Can you help me figure out a method of solving this? Thanks in advance&nbsp;</qco> </h3>      \nhere's what i would recommend, based on similar long term problems i've had, and the best solution that has emerged. it's a hybrid randomization scheme. First, put all the items in a list. 2 different approaches come to mind- 1: using complete randomization to pick (computer generated random selection), but this might end up picking one that you actually don't really want to do. 2: 'just picking the one you want' clearly doesn't work, otherwise you wouldn't be in this situation. So i've found a hybrid system: the way it works is, first you go through the list and choose ones that you think are reasonable choices -- it's ok to pick as many as you want. Add these to a finalists list. then, immediately as soon as you finish making that list, do a random selection based on that new list. And that's your selection. If you don't end up choosing any for the finalists list, then go ahead and just do the random selection on the original list. i hope this helps. i think it is a solid system and it works for me, even in the face of extreme decision anxiety\n<br><br>"
