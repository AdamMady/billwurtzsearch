The rest of the song it's pretty standard pentatonic/heavy rock pseudo phrygian but then you got that major I chord... with a maj IV and a maj bIII... weird. I mean, I think Cage The Elephant does it too with Back Against The Wall, but I have a hard time relating it to anything theory wise.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you help me?
