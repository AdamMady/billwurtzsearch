[checking] october 19, 2018. it was just the first line. then when it came time to pick a song, in december, i think i narrowed it down to about 20 songs and then my mistake was that i went through those 20 and narrowed it down again, and it got narrowed down to zero. so i went back to the list of 20 and picked the one i thought was the weakest. and it was that one. then i wrote it, very fast, because i was still attempting to do the 2-week schedule at that time, but i think it had already fallen apart by then. but i think i had convinced myself of some backup plan during that time. it was a long string of failures during that time, regarding the schedule. other than that i don't remember too much about the writing process. it was pretty standard. oh here's something i remember about the writing: the 'hey, what's the name of this game, ..etc.' all of that, after i wrote that i thought it was great but not right for this song. so i spent quite a while trying to come up with a plan B for that, and save that for a different song. i was really convinced that wasn't going to work for this song, as much as i liked it. then eventually i gave into using it. after that i think the writing went pretty smoothly and quickly. the recording process went slightly slower than some of the previous songs because i was just tired of rushing. it was probably rushed until i realized i had blown whatever the latest deadline was, then i was probably a bit more meticulous after that. and the release got screwed up too, because i was aiming for a certain date with the video so i sent it to the stores 2 days before that date, but couldn't finish the video. so the song hit the stores way before the video, by mistake. it was awkward. that turned out to be what the bad thing was\n<br><br>"
