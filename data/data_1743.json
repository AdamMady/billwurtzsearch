Although I started learning piano at quite a young age, but since it's a keyboard instrument so all you have to do is use your eyes doing some sheet reading then press the keys, and since no one is there to tell me to pay attention to what you hear, until now i'm still lost when all the people there say the only right way to music is to use ear...</qco> </h3>"
