If you lie around thinking about music for long enough you'll notice that you can play the F# and C notes in the chord, with the D bass note, and that gives you the D7 chord, but you can also put the bass on Ab instead and that gives you an Ab7 chord just the same. So a \"tri-tone substitution\" is when you use Ab7 instead of D7. (or A7 instead of Eb7. or Bb7 instead of E7. and so on). seems crazy but it just might work\n\n<br><br>"
