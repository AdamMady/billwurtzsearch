I think I thought about setting a deadline and then thought that I did but was so unconsciously unsure of the merits of setting a deadline that I didn't fully commit to setting it and then didn't follow it because it wasn't set with full commitment. On the one hand, setting a deadline lets me know how much I need to divide my work over time and lets me know when to stop working, but on the other hand if my work isn't finished before the deadline, it will never be finished because it's past the deadline and i've stopped working on it.</qco> </h3>"

You draw the number 17. You put it back, shake the hat to mix it up, draw agin, it's 17 again. Repeat. By pure chance you draw the number 17 a bunch of times in a row, technically possible right? Here's my question- with each 17 that you draw, do your chances of it being 17 get higher or lower?
