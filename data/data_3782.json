And that hot me thinking perhaps its impossible since i dont think i can do any changes to my upward throw to have it have a positive acceleration. I was wondering well how could i achieve that upwards&nbsp;&nbsp;acceleration, counteract gravity and then some. I thiugh of spaceships but that requires fuel. But rubber ducking to you now i realize perhaps some sort of bernoulli effect but i think i cant have bernoulli effect when the incoming wind is in the desired lift vector. Perhaps a winglike thing on the ball but have it be engineered so that the addon itself converts it to upwarda motion. I have no idea how to change a lift vector. You got any ideas? Its important pls</qco> </h3><br><br>"
