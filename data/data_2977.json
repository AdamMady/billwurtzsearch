There's still more work I want to do, lots of the songs feel unfinished, and for the ones that feel finished I have more work I want to do on them (like better mixing etc). Im scared to make a social media account or a place where I can upload my songs, because what will probably happen is no one will care about it, then I'll be embarrassed for having this music project rot on the internet. Also I'm scared that if I upload something, I'll feel the pressure to keep uploading, and that pressure might kill the fun of it and I won't want to make songs anymore. maybe I shouldn't post online at all if I enjoy making songs on my own? I admire how your music is so carefree and you post it all online for everyone to see, but there must have been a moment when you posted your first ever song online, was that hard to do? </qco></h3><br><br>"
