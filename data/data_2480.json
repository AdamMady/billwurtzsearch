Do you think there is a relationship with the meters humans intuitively create music in and the use, or non-use, of a metronome? More generally, do you think there is a meter or pulse pattern that is connects to human psychology more than any other meter? Is there any merit to asking or searching for such a natural meter, or is such a thing purely speculative and based on one's culture/upbringing?
