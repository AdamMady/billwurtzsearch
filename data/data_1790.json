I wouldn't mind it at all - your stuff is great and makes me feel things and I relate so hard to your exploding all over - but now it's so \"loud\" and intense that it's not background music anymore. I really need to explode out my own work!! So I guess my question is - do you ever have to clear your mind out of things you really like so you can hear your own self? How do you do it??</qco> </h3>"
