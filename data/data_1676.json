I'll at least mix things up and put the 7th-tonic rub in the middle of the chord instead of on top, or find myself splitting 5ths doing root and 5th in the left hand and 3 and 7 in the right an octave up, a sus here and there but CAN'T seem to unlock my understanding of more \"colored\" (if you will) or nonfunctional chords and get into chromatic harmony and other techniques I hear in your writing. I'm not asking you to tell me \"play these chords\", but rather if you can suggest reading/watching something to expand my palate of harmony. (have basic diatonic theory under my belt)</qco> </h3>"
