I tried your suggestion and randomizing the hits/rests with the triplets has been super helpful. I also have this app on my phone that's like a metronome but you can plug in the specific rhythm notation, so I've been doing that to check to make sure my timing is good. Couple more questions about this whole thing. Are triplets almost always going going to be grouped in 3's?&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe its not really common cause I'm not seeing it in any of my sheet music, but would you ever see something like one eighth note/rest triplet just by itself immediately followed by a 'regular', non-triplet note/rest?</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And will triplets almost always start right at the top of the beat, like would you ever see 3 quarter note triplets, but starting on the \"and\" of the beat? How would you count out stuff where you kind of have to subdivide a single beat into 3's as well as into\n 2's or 4\n 's for regular eighth or sixteenth notes? (sorry if this is all jumbled, I hope you understand what I mean though).</qco> </h3>"
