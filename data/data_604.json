I've been working for the last 5 years of my life in a concept album (much like how Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" was an album, but also it was more than just that. It was a movie, and a live show, and a compendium of ideas paired with music and visuals). But now, as I find myself at the last stretch of the process, I can't help but feel guilt at how long this all took. I wish a could have done this faster, but maybe it was just the way that it needed to be made. I'm currently having severe panic attacks thinking that maybe this project didn't turn out to be that good and I just wasted the past 5 years of my life. Any thoughts on this? I was thinking that maybe you felt this way when you were at the last stretch of making \"History of Japan\" or \"History of the entire world, i guess\". If that's the case;&nbsp;How did you dealt with that feeling? How can I push through this last stretch of the process and finally finish the thing without failing? Thanks \n Bill.</qco> </h3>"
