Thats kinda odd, does this really happen to you? For example, you say this to another person: \"oh yeah this song is my favourite\", and then instantly another song becomes your favourite.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br>Why do you think that's the case for you? please correct me and explain what you mean by those \"picking favourites\"-statements if i am wrong or i misunderstood you</qco> </h3>"
