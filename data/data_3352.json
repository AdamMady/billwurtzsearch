Then, someone in the group who knows me well pulls me off to the side to talk about or engage in something we both like. i trust that person because then it's like we're in a lifeboat together, and they're pulling me safely to shore. i hope i described that situation well. i guess what i'm asking is, have you ever experienced anything like this? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is it similar to the nice feeling you get when you imagine escaping from apocalyptic scenarios?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
