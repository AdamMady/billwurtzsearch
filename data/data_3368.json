This also applies to melodies and&nbsp;&nbsp;rythms. I've listened to so much music in the last two years that i think i know way to much in comparison to what i knew before. This could seem like a good thing but in fact all the music now just sounds empty. During the last two years i used to get excited when i heard a key change or an original harmonic structure, i used to listen to music all day long and know i feel like i reached the bottom and there isn't much more i can learn. I know i still can but 80% of the total is gone and i no longer enjoy music the same way I did before, ever since december that hardly any song got stuck in my head which it used to be something normal in my everyday life, I was always with songs in my head. The same happens with piano improvisation. I feel like if i no longer have anything to play or listen and I'm starting to l\n ose interest in music in general. What should I do? I don't want to separate music from me. Have you ever felt this way? If so, what did you do?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
