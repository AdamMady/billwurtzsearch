Here is the <a href=\"frontdoorworldbell.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">bell</a>, here is the <a href=\"frontdoorworldpluck.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">pluck</a>, (which, as can be heard in the other clips, is playing an E note at the moment in question. the 'D' note played in the pluck doesn't occur until the second 16th note of bar 17) And finally, here is the <a href=\"frontdoorworldrhodes.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">rhodes</a>, which is playing an Asus4 chord, which of course includes the D note, which, while having absolutely nothing to do with the flute riff in the previous bar, is the only plausible explanation for what sound you're hearing here.
