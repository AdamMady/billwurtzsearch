But when people ask me \"what's good\" I feel like I shouldn't say \"not much\" or \"nothing\" cause that seems like it would be very depressing. \"What's good?\"... \"Not much\"....that makes me seem sad. Are you familiar with the \"what's good\" greeting? How would you normally respond? Am I supposed to just think of any random thing that I think is good?</qco> </h3><br><br>"

For reference, there's blogs and vlogs but I want to make condensed what I'll call \"slogs\" (sound blogs) where I record all the sounds around me (speaking, car sounds, music, radio, footsteps, cooking sounds, animal sounds, literally any sound that can be picked up by a mic) for 24 hours.. then I went to take that 24 hour recording, splice it into 10 second fragments (or maybe 5 seconds or 15 seconds, haven't decided) and layer all the spliced clips on top of eachother and play it all simultaneously so you have this cacophony of 24 hours worth of sounds smashed into 10 seconds... but I don't think recording softwares can handle that much audio files, and cpu or phone batteries don't last 24 hours....

I play guitar and bass, so I'm already familiar with playing music and how rhythm works (all the note/rest values, ties, triplets, etc. I'm even comfortable playing syncopated lines, polyrhythms, different time signatures and all that stuff) But when I actually try to sit down at a set and play around, I sound awful.. Do you think its mostly about building up muscle memory, just getting used to the technique and feeling of the drums? Another roadblock is that I don't own a kit (I live in an old apartment building, with VERY thin walls), so I practice either by tapping my feet while tapping on stuff with my hands, or by \"air drumming\". I really only get to play on an actual kit once a week or so at most (when I go over to a friends house for band practice). Any tips or advice???</qco> </h3><br><br>"
