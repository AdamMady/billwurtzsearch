I write music and every time i make a decision all i can thing is \"X wouldn't do that\" or \"Y said they never do this\" and it keeps me from getting things out on the page. i guess the solution is to just develop my own ideas, but what gives me the authority to do that? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who do i think i am doing something that conflicts with what (some cool musician i admire) said?</qco> </h3>"
