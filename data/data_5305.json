So instead of memorizing 2 8note chords,</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oh no<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i memorized 4 4 note chords,</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oh no this is all wrong<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it always made sense since it felt like memorizing smaller chunks would make it easier. The thing is, when moving from first set of 8 to second set of 8, the checklist becomes twice as long when trying to make the change fast, since I have to run the checklist of 2 4 note chords as opposed to a big one. So my mind is split making sure I got the left hand right and then the right hand right (and with the memorized finger positions).</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does your keyboard have sound? make sure you are checking how these things sound because what you are describing sounds frightful<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let's say I have a less than ideal memorized way of placing my fingers on the notes because that's how i first came upon them, then I would just be repeating my mistake everytime simply because thats how i memorized the 2 blocks. But on the other hand if my \"mental check list\" goes note by note from the bottom up, then my hands might fix the mistake the second time i play by going \"ah, that makes more sense how my fingers landed on the notes this time around\" and instead of memorizing how to place my hand on them, my hands start learning finger placement instinct in a sense, and i have more mental space to do/think other things. I always thought it was easier to memorize both blocks because, lets say for the second 8 note chord I could memorize Gb7</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just for some perspective, i've already mentioned that i think  you are living in a completely alternate universe from me, and that might be ok, but, generally if I see Gb7 on the page, the basic go-to way i would play this (not taking any context into account), and if i am the only instrument (not a band) i would play 1 note in the left hand and 2 notes in the right hand. Left hand is bass note Gb (let's say the 92.5hz one) and the right hand is playing Bb and E (233 and 330). depending on context and what key the song is in etc etc you might need a little more (maybe add Db in between) but that voicing would pretty much be the standard for me. If i'm in a band and there is already a bass player there, do the same thing but skip the bass note<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on left hand and a Bbadd9 on the right hand, both on root position. But I am coming to the realization that seeing them this way may intelectualize the process too much and make me think&nbsp;&nbsp;of music in more math/pattern terms rather than feeling the music. As for the puzzle part, if i just play the right notes and not worry about which hand does which, the hands slowly start gaining instinct of how to play what. And everytime you play them, you're figuring out the finger-placement puzzle again, or atleast starting to make the connection of both hands working as one as opposed to LH does x, RH does&nbsp;&nbsp;y. Another advantage I believe is that when changes need to be made to the voicing they are made to the whole at the same time, and rebalancing voices in the other hand to fit the change becomes easier. Because you don't need to relearn both blocks again and/or how they differ from the previous version of the chord, you just need to solve a new puzzle when playing.Mentally it feels kind of like the first time I started seeing the harmonies in classical music as opposed to just learning the notes and the order they come in at. Way easier to play bach's prelude 1 if you know the chords that are being arpeggiated rather than learning/reading each note by itself as it comes. I thin I am slowly unhindering myself of the limitations of the way I learned to play music as a kid. It just always seemed so intimidating to me seeing people improv 2 handed chords</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think you are overestimating the existence of 2 handed chords. if you are using 2 hands for a chord, your hands should either be very very close (like in the same range) and hopefully not playing more than about 6 notes max (beyond that it just gets crazy dense ... if you add more notes, they should be on the same notes you're already playing. which means other instruments have to play them) OR, you have a chord with your right hand and 1 note in the bass range. but only do this if you have absolutely no other bass player in your group<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over changes and I thin perhaps they weren't thining of them as 2 separate blocks one for each hand, but as one whole thing. The other advantage to not seeing it as 2 hands I believe is that it's easy to say, well that chord needs one less note, and just play the chord and let the fingers figure out who plays who, as opposed to trying to keep balance or saying \"well, there was 4 and 4, now theres 4 and 3, i should probably take one out of the left hand too to make it balanced\" when the balance perhaps doesn't lie in number of notes in each hand but simply what the music needs, which might not always makes sense in the pattern/balance-seeking frame of mind. I hope it makes more sense or atleast shows what I'm thinking better.\n<br>\n<br>Tl;dr, \"Gb7 on left hand, Bbadd9 on right hand\" turns into G-Bb-D-F-Bb-C-D-F.</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oh you meant Gmin7. the example i gave before was for Gb7. --- Gb7 actually means Gb dominant 7<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First one might make more sense for writing down/analyzing, second might be more instinctive and wont rely on having to make sense of each hand as an individual chord. Like, on the example of the first chord F-Ab-C-Eb-G-Bb-Eb-G, itd be hard to categorize G-Bb-Eb-G as a recognizable chord, perhaps some sort of Eb in first inversion with a doubled 3rd on the top but I want to let my ears do the listening, my fingers the playing and my mind the enjoying instead of intelectualizing it. It may seem I'm saying the newer way im doing it is better but I think maybe it just complements something that's been lacking in my approach to music thus far and a balance must be found as opposed to committing to one way or the other. I find the mind of a piano harmony improvizer intriguing and I hope this new approach makes it less convoluted in my head. It just seems like itll be way easier to improvize when im not trying to first make two independent hand voicings and placing them together as opposed to thining of a big voicing spread through all my fingers (and let them do the chosing of which plays what note as opposed to summoning up some finger positions from the catalogue since my catalogue may be too limited atm. It feels like when playing with this new frame of mind, it's easier to try new stuff and let the music speak to me. How do you approach memorizing/improvizing voicings when you are writing/arranging/playing?&nbsp;</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i've really never memorized anything of that sort. most of the learning i've ever done with regard to keyboard / chords / fingering, etc, has been a result of spending a very very long time with the keyboard in a deep state of experimental enjoyment. also i will mention again that this default idea that both hands are supposed to play a chord seems all wrong. the only scenario really where i think that would be a good idea is if you had 2 keyboards and you were playing them right in the same range and at least some of the notes are the same. the magic range where harmony/chords work is generally very small (within about 1 octave range). when you spread out, at least on the low side, you'll want single notes only (for bass range). and if you are talking about spreading way up higher, still i think you are going to find that this \"each hand plays a chord\" idea is just not sound. at least i think that's what you find when you start really paying attention to the sound\n<br><br><h3> \n</h3></quoteaco></quotequestion>",

The thing is, when moving from first set of 8 to second set of 8, the checklist becomes twice as long when trying to make the change fast, since I have to run the checklist of 2 4 note chords as opposed to a big one. So my mind is split making sure I got the left hand right and then the right hand right (and with the memorized finger positions).</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does your keyboard have sound? make sure you are checking how these things sound because what you are describing sounds frightful<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let's say I have a less than ideal memorized way of placing my fingers on the notes because that's how i first came upon them, then I would just be repeating my mistake everytime simply because thats how i memorized the 2 blocks. But on the other hand if my \"mental check list\" goes note by note from the bottom up, then my hands might fix the mistake the second time i play by going \"ah, that makes more sense how my fingers landed on the notes this time around\" and instead of memorizing how to place my hand on them, my hands start learning finger placement instinct in a sense, and i have more mental space to do/think other things. I always thought it was easier to memorize both blocks because, lets say for the second 8 note chord I could memorize Gb7</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just for some perspective, i've already mentioned that i think  you are living in a completely alternate universe from me, and that might be ok, but, generally if I see Gb7 on the page, the basic go-to way i would play this (not taking any context into account), and if i am the only instrument (not a band) i would play 1 note in the left hand and 2 notes in the right hand. Left hand is bass note Gb (let's say the 92.5hz one) and the right hand is playing Bb and E (233 and 330). depending on context and what key the song is in etc etc you might need a little more (maybe add Db in between) but that voicing would pretty much be the standard for me. If i'm in a band and there is already a bass player there, do the same thing but skip the bass note<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on left hand and a Bbadd9 on the right hand, both on root position. But I am coming to the realization that seeing them this way may intelectualize the process too much and make me think&nbsp;&nbsp;of music in more math/pattern terms rather than feeling the music. As for the puzzle part, if i just play the right notes and not worry about which hand does which, the hands slowly start gaining instinct of how to play what. And everytime you play them, you're figuring out the finger-placement puzzle again, or atleast starting to make the connection of both hands working as one as opposed to LH does x, RH does&nbsp;&nbsp;y. Another advantage I believe is that when changes need to be made to the voicing they are made to the whole at the same time, and rebalancing voices in the other hand to fit the change becomes easier. Because you don't need to relearn both blocks again and/or how they differ from the previous version of the chord, you just need to solve a new puzzle when playing.Mentally it feels kind of like the first time I started seeing the harmonies in classical music as opposed to just learning the notes and the order they come in at. Way easier to play bach's prelude 1 if you know the chords that are being arpeggiated rather than learning/reading each note by itself as it comes. I thin I am slowly unhindering myself of the limitations of the way I learned to play music as a kid. It just always seemed so intimidating to me seeing people improv 2 handed chords</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think you are overestimating the existence of 2 handed chords. if you are using 2 hands for a chord, your hands should either be very very close (like in the same range) and hopefully not playing more than about 6 notes max (beyond that it just gets crazy dense ... if you add more notes, they should be on the same notes you're already playing. which means other instruments have to play them) OR, you have a chord with your right hand and 1 note in the bass range. but only do this if you have absolutely no other bass player in your group<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over changes and I thin perhaps they weren't thining of them as 2 separate blocks one for each hand, but as one whole thing. The other advantage to not seeing it as 2 hands I believe is that it's easy to say, well that chord needs one less note, and just play the chord and let the fingers figure out who plays who, as opposed to trying to keep balance or saying \"well, there was 4 and 4, now theres 4 and 3, i should probably take one out of the left hand too to make it balanced\" when the balance perhaps doesn't lie in number of notes in each hand but simply what the music needs, which might not always makes sense in the pattern/balance-seeking frame of mind. I hope it makes more sense or atleast shows what I'm thinking better.\n<br>\n<br>Tl;dr, \"Gb7 on left hand, Bbadd9 on right hand\" turns into G-Bb-D-F-Bb-C-D-F.</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oh you meant Gmin7. the example i gave before was for Gb7. --- Gb7 actually means Gb dominant 7<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First one might make more sense for writing down/analyzing, second might be more instinctive and wont rely on having to make sense of each hand as an individual chord. Like, on the example of the first chord F-Ab-C-Eb-G-Bb-Eb-G, itd be hard to categorize G-Bb-Eb-G as a recognizable chord, perhaps some sort of Eb in first inversion with a doubled 3rd on the top but I want to let my ears do the listening, my fingers the playing and my mind the enjoying instead of intelectualizing it. It may seem I'm saying the newer way im doing it is better but I think maybe it just complements something that's been lacking in my approach to music thus far and a balance must be found as opposed to committing to one way or the other. I find the mind of a piano harmony improvizer intriguing and I hope this new approach makes it less convoluted in my head. It just seems like itll be way easier to improvize when im not trying to first make two independent hand voicings and placing them together as opposed to thining of a big voicing spread through all my fingers (and let them do the chosing of which plays what note as opposed to summoning up some finger positions from the catalogue since my catalogue may be too limited atm. It feels like when playing with this new frame of mind, it's easier to try new stuff and let the music speak to me. How do you approach memorizing/improvizing voicings when you are writing/arranging/playing?&nbsp;</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i've really never memorized anything of that sort. most of the learning i've ever done with regard to keyboard / chords / fingering, etc, has been a result of spending a very very long time with the keyboard in a deep state of experimental enjoyment. also i will mention again that this default idea that both hands are supposed to play a chord seems all wrong. the only scenario really where i think that would be a good idea is if you had 2 keyboards and you were playing them right in the same range and at least some of the notes are the same. the magic range where harmony/chords work is generally very small (within about 1 octave range). when you spread out, at least on the low side, you'll want single notes only (for bass range). and if you are talking about spreading way up higher, still i think you are going to find that this \"each hand plays a chord\" idea is just not sound. at least i think that's what you find when you start really paying attention to the sound\n<br><br><h3> \n</h3>"

So my mind is split making sure I got the left hand right and then the right hand right (and with the memorized finger positions).</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does your keyboard have sound? make sure you are checking how these things sound because what you are describing sounds frightful<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let's say I have a less than ideal memorized way of placing my fingers on the notes because that's how i first came upon them, then I would just be repeating my mistake everytime simply because thats how i memorized the 2 blocks. But on the other hand if my \"mental check list\" goes note by note from the bottom up, then my hands might fix the mistake the second time i play by going \"ah, that makes more sense how my fingers landed on the notes this time around\" and instead of memorizing how to place my hand on them, my hands start learning finger placement instinct in a sense, and i have more mental space to do/think other things. I always thought it was easier to memorize both blocks because, lets say for the second 8 note chord I could memorize Gb7</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just for some perspective, i've already mentioned that i think  you are living in a completely alternate universe from me, and that might be ok, but, generally if I see Gb7 on the page, the basic go-to way i would play this (not taking any context into account), and if i am the only instrument (not a band) i would play 1 note in the left hand and 2 notes in the right hand. Left hand is bass note Gb (let's say the 92.5hz one) and the right hand is playing Bb and E (233 and 330). depending on context and what key the song is in etc etc you might need a little more (maybe add Db in between) but that voicing would pretty much be the standard for me. If i'm in a band and there is already a bass player there, do the same thing but skip the bass note<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on left hand and a Bbadd9 on the right hand, both on root position. But I am coming to the realization that seeing them this way may intelectualize the process too much and make me think&nbsp;&nbsp;of music in more math/pattern terms rather than feeling the music. As for the puzzle part, if i just play the right notes and not worry about which hand does which, the hands slowly start gaining instinct of how to play what. And everytime you play them, you're figuring out the finger-placement puzzle again, or atleast starting to make the connection of both hands working as one as opposed to LH does x, RH does&nbsp;&nbsp;y. Another advantage I believe is that when changes need to be made to the voicing they are made to the whole at the same time, and rebalancing voices in the other hand to fit the change becomes easier. Because you don't need to relearn both blocks again and/or how they differ from the previous version of the chord, you just need to solve a new puzzle when playing.Mentally it feels kind of like the first time I started seeing the harmonies in classical music as opposed to just learning the notes and the order they come in at. Way easier to play bach's prelude 1 if you know the chords that are being arpeggiated rather than learning/reading each note by itself as it comes. I thin I am slowly unhindering myself of the limitations of the way I learned to play music as a kid. It just always seemed so intimidating to me seeing people improv 2 handed chords</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think you are overestimating the existence of 2 handed chords. if you are using 2 hands for a chord, your hands should either be very very close (like in the same range) and hopefully not playing more than about 6 notes max (beyond that it just gets crazy dense ... if you add more notes, they should be on the same notes you're already playing. which means other instruments have to play them) OR, you have a chord with your right hand and 1 note in the bass range. but only do this if you have absolutely no other bass player in your group<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over changes and I thin perhaps they weren't thining of them as 2 separate blocks one for each hand, but as one whole thing. The other advantage to not seeing it as 2 hands I believe is that it's easy to say, well that chord needs one less note, and just play the chord and let the fingers figure out who plays who, as opposed to trying to keep balance or saying \"well, there was 4 and 4, now theres 4 and 3, i should probably take one out of the left hand too to make it balanced\" when the balance perhaps doesn't lie in number of notes in each hand but simply what the music needs, which might not always makes sense in the pattern/balance-seeking frame of mind. I hope it makes more sense or atleast shows what I'm thinking better.\n<br>\n<br>Tl;dr, \"Gb7 on left hand, Bbadd9 on right hand\" turns into G-Bb-D-F-Bb-C-D-F.</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oh you meant Gmin7. the example i gave before was for Gb7. --- Gb7 actually means Gb dominant 7<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First one might make more sense for writing down/analyzing, second might be more instinctive and wont rely on having to make sense of each hand as an individual chord. Like, on the example of the first chord F-Ab-C-Eb-G-Bb-Eb-G, itd be hard to categorize G-Bb-Eb-G as a recognizable chord, perhaps some sort of Eb in first inversion with a doubled 3rd on the top but I want to let my ears do the listening, my fingers the playing and my mind the enjoying instead of intelectualizing it. It may seem I'm saying the newer way im doing it is better but I think maybe it just complements something that's been lacking in my approach to music thus far and a balance must be found as opposed to committing to one way or the other. I find the mind of a piano harmony improvizer intriguing and I hope this new approach makes it less convoluted in my head. It just seems like itll be way easier to improvize when im not trying to first make two independent hand voicings and placing them together as opposed to thining of a big voicing spread through all my fingers (and let them do the chosing of which plays what note as opposed to summoning up some finger positions from the catalogue since my catalogue may be too limited atm. It feels like when playing with this new frame of mind, it's easier to try new stuff and let the music speak to me. How do you approach memorizing/improvizing voicings when you are writing/arranging/playing?&nbsp;</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i've really never memorized anything of that sort. most of the learning i've ever done with regard to keyboard / chords / fingering, etc, has been a result of spending a very very long time with the keyboard in a deep state of experimental enjoyment. also i will mention again that this default idea that both hands are supposed to play a chord seems all wrong. the only scenario really where i think that would be a good idea is if you had 2 keyboards and you were playing them right in the same range and at least some of the notes are the same. the magic range where harmony/chords work is generally very small (within about 1 octave range). when you spread out, at least on the low side, you'll want single notes only (for bass range). and if you are talking about spreading way up higher, still i think you are going to find that this \"each hand plays a chord\" idea is just not sound. at least i think that's what you find when you start really paying attention to the sound\n<br><br><h3> \n</h3>"

(and also many nintendo games) and the chords are F, Fdim, C/G, A7. it really blew my mind to hear that the A note on the Fdim chord actually had F natural harmonized under it. that was the worst offender. it just HAS to be F#. now, it's easy for me to sit here and complain, but i must admit, from experience, in some cases you may go in and make it what you think it's supposed to be and it just doesn't work. Sometimes you see these paradoxes where the bass will do it the twisty way and the melody will just completely ignore the twists and do it straight, and for some reason it just works fine that way when you breeze through it. it's one of the great mysteries of life. The other issue, which was a little bit less disturbing but yet still defied all norms of the 'genre', is the A7, which in every fiber of instinct feels like it was supposed to be A7, and the harmony note should have been C#, but in reality they used C. this is not nearly as big a 'crime' as the F and A notes over the F# bass, but yet still common sense and experience of the 'genre' still begs that to be A7, at that point in the song. It really makes you want to wonder if there is some technoligical restriction at play, preventing us from having any melody or harmony notes outside the plain C major scale set. but this is disproved if we take a look at the other section, on the D7 chord, we have F#s right in there. The only other thing i MIGHT be inclined to hypothesize is that the melody and harmony line were written and programmed before the bass was there? and it was planned to be less 'jazz' and more 1, 4, 5 triads. then when the bass came along there was somehow a decision to go more 'jazz' and yet the harmony was not changed to match the bass. This is unlikely and doesn't match nintendo's reputation for perfection especially in these types of genres, they usually absolutely nail this stuff. or again to restate my other theory it could simply be that upon trying the 'correct' 'twisty' harmonies there you would expect, it might have just not sounded right. one of the great mysteries of the universe, but sometimes that is the case. BUT, without constructing a sound-alike and testing for myself, my current hypothesis is that it does weaken the song at those moments to have the notes in there the way they currently are, and i do believe it would be stronger if those were sharped. but i am only about 85-90% sure, short of actually constructing a sound-alike and trying it at tempo and in context\n<br><br><h3> \n</h3></quoteaco></quotequestion>",

The other issue, which was a little bit less disturbing but yet still defied all norms of the 'genre', is the A7, which in every fiber of instinct feels like it was supposed to be A7, and the harmony note should have been C#, but in reality they used C. this is not nearly as big a 'crime' as the F and A notes over the F# bass, but yet still common sense and experience of the 'genre' still begs that to be A7, at that point in the song. It really makes you want to wonder if there is some technoligical restriction at play, preventing us from having any melody or harmony notes outside the plain C major scale set. but this is disproved if we take a look at the other section, on the D7 chord, we have F#s right in there. The only other thing i MIGHT be inclined to hypothesize is that the melody and harmony line were written and programmed before the bass was there? and it was planned to be less 'jazz' and more 1, 4, 5 triads. then when the bass came along there was somehow a decision to go more 'jazz' and yet the harmony was not changed to match the bass. This is unlikely and doesn't match nintendo's reputation for perfection especially in these types of genres, they usually absolutely nail this stuff. or again to restate my other theory it could simply be that upon trying the 'correct' 'twisty' harmonies there you would expect, it might have just not sounded right. one of the great mysteries of the universe, but sometimes that is the case. BUT, without constructing a sound-alike and testing for myself, my current hypothesis is that it does weaken the song at those moments to have the notes in there the way they currently are, and i do believe it would be stronger if those were sharped. but i am only about 85-90% sure, short of actually constructing a sound-alike and trying it at tempo and in context\n<br><br><h3> \n</h3>"

So let's get our F, that's gonna be a true 5th down from C, right? now A should be a pure major third above F, for sure. and B should surely be a pure major 3rd above G. now what should D be? you would assume that it would be a pure ninth from C (i.e. the frequency times 9 and then divided back down the octaves) which is good for the G chord also because it will be a 5th away from G. looks great, so now you've got C, D, E, F, G, A, B. but what you find next might come as a shock. D minor sounds like a nightmare. because D to A is supposed to be a 5th and now it is a very very wrong 5th. because you tuned your A to be a harmonically pure major 3rd away from F. no matter how you slice it, you inevitably run into the same argument where a 3rd needs to be a purely harmonic 3rd, but also needs to be a series of 5ths. i juggled the possibilities all around for at least a day, and i was completely stunned to find out that the essence of music, and specifically the way the \"secondary\" notes (let's say in a major key, the secondary notes are D, F, A, and also G, and the primary notes are C,E,G. that's right, G is both, the universe is a love paradox, get used to it) the secondary notes need equal tempered tuning to work right. there are surely many different ways to look at this and i made up the primary and secondary classifications for this example, but the point is that there will always be overlap. you will never have 2 exclusive sets of notes. it stems from the fact that the D note needs to be able to relate to G, but also needs to relate to the A, but the A also needs to relate to the F, and the F also definitely needs to relate to the C. now you might say \"ok, tune them differently depending on what chords you're using.\" but that really doesn't work right, because music needs all these notes to coexist. you're not going to just expect that Dmin and Fmaj will never need to blend together with the A held over. or that Dmin and Gmaj will never need to blend together with the D held over. At the end of this mind exploding journey, i basically found that it seems to be summed up perfectly in 2 chords. Cmaj, and like any combination of D,F,A, and G perhaps with G in the bass. in that 'secondary' chord, all in one moment, (which is the 'less' stable of the 2 chords when they are used in a musical context) that chord encapsulates the dual nature of the way these harmonies are working. is the F in that chord supposed to relate mainly to the C? or is it supposed to relate to the D in a pure minor third? and similarly, is the D supposed to relate to the G? the answer is, all 3 of these relationships are supposed to hold together. but this is mathematically impossible to happen exactly. so the entire essence of that Dmin, or 5dom7(sus if you like?) whatever, 'secondary' chord, the entire essence of that chord is that it contains different relationships that have to all sound like they work and yet they could never all 3 work exactly. the chord needs compromise in order to work. perhaps that is why it feels like the secondary chord or the 'less stable' or the 'i'm just waiting to go back to C' chord. realizing this changed me, because i was always told that equal tempered tuning was mainly used as a compromise to play in all 12 keys. but what i realized is you actually need it just to play in 1 key. like, just to play a 1 and a 2min. just to play the most basic essence of a key and have it work with itself. it really made me appreciate that 'secondary' chord (Dmin, G, etc) the D to F and the D to G relationship on kind of an earth shattering spiritual level, it's like the damn thing has heartbreak built right in. what you think you are hearing is the d to f relationship and the d to g relationship and the f to c relationthip, etc, all at the same time, when really it could never be, at least not exactly. but it is close enough to feel it. basically ever since this experiment i have had a wildly new appreciation for how and why music works, on an even more 'human' level than i expected. and i never questioned equal tempered tuning again\n<br><br><h3> \n</h3></quoteaco></quotequestion>",

D minor sounds like a nightmare. because D to A is supposed to be a 5th and now it is a very very wrong 5th. because you tuned your A to be a harmonically pure major 3rd away from F. no matter how you slice it, you inevitably run into the same argument where a 3rd needs to be a purely harmonic 3rd, but also needs to be a series of 5ths. i juggled the possibilities all around for at least a day, and i was completely stunned to find out that the essence of music, and specifically the way the \"secondary\" notes (let's say in a major key, the secondary notes are D, F, A, and also G, and the primary notes are C,E,G. that's right, G is both, the universe is a love paradox, get used to it) the secondary notes need equal tempered tuning to work right. there are surely many different ways to look at this and i made up the primary and secondary classifications for this example, but the point is that there will always be overlap. you will never have 2 exclusive sets of notes. it stems from the fact that the D note needs to be able to relate to G, but also needs to relate to the A, but the A also needs to relate to the F, and the F also definitely needs to relate to the C. now you might say \"ok, tune them differently depending on what chords you're using.\" but that really doesn't work right, because music needs all these notes to coexist. you're not going to just expect that Dmin and Fmaj will never need to blend together with the A held over. or that Dmin and Gmaj will never need to blend together with the D held over. At the end of this mind exploding journey, i basically found that it seems to be summed up perfectly in 2 chords. Cmaj, and like any combination of D,F,A, and G perhaps with G in the bass. in that 'secondary' chord, all in one moment, (which is the 'less' stable of the 2 chords when they are used in a musical context) that chord encapsulates the dual nature of the way these harmonies are working. is the F in that chord supposed to relate mainly to the C? or is it supposed to relate to the D in a pure minor third? and similarly, is the D supposed to relate to the G? the answer is, all 3 of these relationships are supposed to hold together. but this is mathematically impossible to happen exactly. so the entire essence of that Dmin, or 5dom7(sus if you like?) whatever, 'secondary' chord, the entire essence of that chord is that it contains different relationships that have to all sound like they work and yet they could never all 3 work exactly. the chord needs compromise in order to work. perhaps that is why it feels like the secondary chord or the 'less stable' or the 'i'm just waiting to go back to C' chord. realizing this changed me, because i was always told that equal tempered tuning was mainly used as a compromise to play in all 12 keys. but what i realized is you actually need it just to play in 1 key. like, just to play a 1 and a 2min. just to play the most basic essence of a key and have it work with itself. it really made me appreciate that 'secondary' chord (Dmin, G, etc) the D to F and the D to G relationship on kind of an earth shattering spiritual level, it's like the damn thing has heartbreak built right in. what you think you are hearing is the d to f relationship and the d to g relationship and the f to c relationthip, etc, all at the same time, when really it could never be, at least not exactly. but it is close enough to feel it. basically ever since this experiment i have had a wildly new appreciation for how and why music works, on an even more 'human' level than i expected. and i never questioned equal tempered tuning again\n<br><br><h3> \n</h3>"

All the albums that really are worth the candle and aren't just \"compilations of songs\" already do that, at least in my eyes. Take Daft Punk's Discovery for example, or Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope. Albums that have so many twists and turns that to share only one song off of it at a time is kind of doing it an injustice. THAT'S a sign of a good album - when you need someone to take in the total package rather than just a singular song.

Me personally, I view albums as more like a book or a short story, where each track is a particularly memorable sentence from a chapter that sticks in your head, or a plot twist/intriguing moment or something like that. The whole purpose of an album in my opinion is to create a story that's bigger than just one song could provide, or rather tell one story but with a lot of nuance and detail to it.

All the albums that really are worth the candle and aren't just \"compilations of songs\" already do that, at least in my eyes. Take Daft Punk's Discovery for example, or Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope. Albums that have so many twists and turns that to share only one song off of it at a time is kind of doing it an injustice. THAT'S a sign of a good album - when you need someone to take in the total package rather than just a singular song. It'd be like taking a chord from a song and just playing that rather than the whole song;&nbsp;sure you can do it, but to get the whole scope of things, you need the entire track. An album should be like that, I feel.</qco> </h3>",

Me personally, I view albums as more like a book or a short story, where each track is a particularly memorable sentence from a chapter that sticks in your head, or a plot twist/intriguing moment or something like that. The whole purpose of an album in my opinion is to create a story that's bigger than just one song could provide, or rather tell one story but with a lot of nuance and detail to it.
