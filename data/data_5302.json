Unfortunately, these annotations are Only available on youtube, meaning the downloadable version on your website is \"More False,\" and therefore to some, \"Not As Good.\" But, I enjoy having a version on my computer! You may have considered some options to prevent a situation where you have to add annotations, but have you considered-\nReleasing a version that you're satisfied with to the people who read this \"estqunois\" page, so that they can catch the things you might not have, and then incorporating those edits into a \"Final Version\" that you upload to youtube? I know you're not sure about collaborations, but but adding the annotations was a \"Collaboration\" of sorts; And, you seem to be accustomed to the input of the \"people\" on this page already.

Everything after graphics (score, jingles, narration, labels, troubleshoot, etc etc) for history of japan took a total of 30 days. so even if i finish graphics by thursday (wildly impossible) i would have to complete what was 30 days (for a 9 min vid) in 13 days (for a 19 min vid.) so basically that would require more than a 4x speed improvement from what i was doing in dec/jan last year on japan. but, graphics so far has generally been running at 2x speed from last year. i don't know how that's possible. maybe because i'm not trying to make vines every day? not really sure how to account for it, but i guess i have more experience now<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">11.13.16&nbsp;\n6:06 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> I think I'm getting it.

the reason this video might take a while because of your other job during the week, or are the days you work on the video, solely for the video and work vice-versa?(I hope to god that made

started<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">10.6.16&nbsp;\n9:09 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> what progress have you made on the video today?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today had some very intense setbacks and yet very intense progress. lately as i've shifted into the beginning stages of production (from writing) the looming magnitude of this project has intensified even more, which is hard to even imagine considering it was already unimaginably intense (the research and writing actually took 12 weeks.) there are endless new challenges, and i saw some particularly technical ones today, relating to processing power, etc. i will need to make small comprimises across the board in order to do anything at a respectable pace. that's about all i can say without going into detail. on the other hand, i had some victories content wise, regarding re-writes and trims. at what is now 5:56, this point was at 7:15 in the first draft. this is good news because i was concerned that the original 22 min draft not only had some tedious and tiresome parts, but it is also not reasonable to ever expect to finish the video if it is that long. getting into the swing of these re-writes, the prospect looks good for actually bringing this endlessly long thing down to a still-very-long but very swift and exciting adventure, and also be feasibly finishable by the end of the decade<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">10.6.16&nbsp;\n1:26 am</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> When you say too long (referring to the video your

seconds within the first 6 minutes, and i hope to continue tightening it at an equal or better pace, while also adding more information, which i understand is a paradox<br><br><h3> <font

stages are in the creation of your video? </font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i guess the major stages for the last one (and it worked very well) was: write, plan, graphics, narr, jingles, score. the 'plan' stage is sort of ambiguous, and a lot of the graphic work actually gets done during that stage, it's basically like figuring out how the hell i am actually going to display on the screen what i just said in the script, and it actually inolves doing a lot more research, like nailing down exact geography specifics so i can show them on the map, or finding the images of people, etc etc. the script also may change a bit during this phase, and i really hope it does, because it is too long and also doesn't include enough, which i understand is a paradox<br><br><h3> <font

country, sequentially, but that kind of linear thinking is just irresponsible for a human being with less than a 100 year lifespan. the japan video was just a prototype to see if i could do a long video in the first place. that opens the door to many many other possibilities, not limited to countries, not limited to geography, not limited to history. it's kind of like if you just bought your first 3d printer, and you print a baseball. what are you gonna print next? more sports balls? why not something different, like a car or a plane, or even a time machine<br><br><h3> <font

I'm not sure where people stand on this issue. i just can't take being accused of not doing something i AM doing, AND it is something i want to do. i want to do them both, so it is very difficult to see where to go here. in a way, i want to start doing songs every week, like NOW, but at the same time i gotta get this history video done. Even people who defend me say \"hey, he only wanted to make history of japan, that was a one-time deal. leave him alone.\" but it's NOT a one-time deal whatsoever. japan was just a test run of a much greater realm of the research format. So either way i am stuck. it's a lot like how i felt stuck between vine and history, before the history video came out, everyone thought i was an 'idiot' and 'irresponsible' for not following through on more vines. it's hard to figure out who is in the majority, and i don't think i should. i saw a content creator try to do a voting system for what the fans thought he should do, and i was honestly very turned off by the idea. i was thinking \"you're the dude, i'm following YOU, ... if you're the leader and you don't know where to go, that's not a very strong sign of leadership.\" so i generally try to stay away from trying to go strictly where the majority would say i should go. besides, if i did that, there's no way i would have taken the risk to do history of japan when i already had a vibrant vine following. &nbsp;so ultimately i have to do what i think is right, and i am extremely torn between songs and big videos at this juncture, but this particular video is turning out to be really large and epic and i think it is exactly what needs to happen right now. and it could easily take a few more months if i work SOLIDLY on it. who knows what may happen if i try to take detours and do songs.... that will make it take even longer, and imagine how much more intense the lectures will get<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">7.14.16&nbsp;\n4:16 am</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> You clearly don't value the opportunity you've opened up for yourself.

(at that point, i will also have a solid estimate of how long it is). the next phase is \"prelim graphics collection\", which would be finding all the materials i need to download, so in the case of Japan, it would be pictures of emperors and stuff, maps (even if i'm not using the map, i need to find maps that show the proper locations of the things i am mentioning.) A lot of times this means i have to do more research, because if i say \"and then they built a palace, right here\" ... i now have to dig back into the research and really pinpoint where and when that palace is supposed to be, and find the right picture, etc. This phase also can see a few re-writes happening, because i might notice certain parts are not hitting the way i want, or are possibly impossible to explain graphically<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">7.27.16&nbsp;\n7:31 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> when is the next educational video\n\n\n</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doing it now<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">7.9.16&nbsp;\n1:27 am</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> Do you anticipate acclaim similar to 'History of Japan' for your next video?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think it has a higher potential for success than history of japan did. but i can't control what happens after i release it. i just have to do the best i can while making it, as usual<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">7.8.16&nbsp;\n6:52 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> was the thing you said about graphic tablets sarcastic</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no! that would revolutionize my game!! to be able to actually draw stuff!!! i should actually get one, like, NOW, it could really come in handy for the video i'm writing now<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">7.8.16&nbsp;\n11:45 am</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> have you got a graphic tablet? got any oppinions on graphic tablets? reccomandations?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WOW i wish, you just made me seriously consider getting one. wow<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">7.8.16&nbsp;\n8:21 am</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> It sounds as though you'll be doing \"History of\" a more arbitrary topic than countries.

So that tells me that the total length of the video should probably be at least double what i have so far. If i can get it to work in 10min, that would be great. if it goes up to 15 min and stays engaging and interesting all the way through, i think that would be fine. Japan video was 9, and it took 98 days of solid work to finish it, but i was also doing 6 second vines every day for most of that time, which i am now not doing. also i have probably learned some things from experience and perhaps things will move faster. then again, this video might require many new kinds of graphics tricks. i am working as fast as possible, as always<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">7.6.16&nbsp;\n11:46 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> Do you plan on travelling anywhere anytime soon?

I mean you have over 13mil vievs on history of japan.

I never meant to only do one.... and i can see that people are getting the idea that i only wanted to do 1... which makes me want to throw a frying pan. i'm doing a billion of these. the other problem, however, is that i've been accumulating songs for the last many many many years, and i've wanted to do that even longer. so those 2 things are the main things that are ripping me apart right now. really really short videos, honestly are not much of a contender right now. \nso i am working on the big one, in the writing stages now, and it's going great. although it will take way too long, but that was true with the last one. and i still managed to finish it before armageddon<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">6.26.16&nbsp;\n5:57 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> japan was picked randomly. was the new topic also picked randomly or was it one you had chosen because you wanted to do it?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the one i'm doing now is much, much, much less random. it's exactly the kind of thing you would do after you've already done a test side-topic to make sure you knew what you were doing<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">6.25.16&nbsp; \n9:31 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> For the history series, I know you're not going to reveal the exact country you're working on now, but are you sticking with the Southeast Asian region or are you going to make the series about countries from any region of the world?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the one i'm working on now is ..... \"Different\"\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">6.25.16&nbsp;\n8:31 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> too many people are being disrespectful on your recent video.  what can we do to stop this??</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i actually didn't know until i started receiving questions on the subject. you can choose to do what you want, but there is nothing i can do about it. i need to keep doing what i'm doing, which ironically is writing another history video .... which i'm not sure if i want to do anymore, because most people who want that seem to be total monsters<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">6.25.16&nbsp; \n8:02 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> what if your next history video turns out to be a flop?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what if your entire life turns out to be a flop\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">6.25.16&nbsp; \n5:45 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> Hey was looking at the video you just posted on yt, and I saw a ton of comments saying stuff like \"why won't he make more history videos\" and I got really annoyed.

(if i can say everything i want to say in 3, that would be fine too. if it takes 15, ...... i guess that's fine too.) japan clocked in at exactly 9 minutes on the first timed run through. i am also working on this video every day, every available hour (just like the last one.) The main difference between this time and last time is this: during the 14 weeks that it took to make history of japan, i was also writing and creating short videos for vine Every Single Day for about the first 2/3 of the time i was working on history of japan. so that would be maybe about half the work time each day devoted to vine, and NOT the history video. Now i am not doing that. so that would be a significant reason why this video might get done faster. Also, after making history of japan, i have refined some of my techniques a bit more, and might be able to work faster.  However, the scope of this topic is a bit different, which might present some unforseen challenges. There is also a small chance that I may decide to make a short video just to have Something to release during the long haul (although i might NOT do that, because that will only directly delay the release of the long video.) The good news is, i have a 1 minute song and music video already completed which i am waiting to upload. i am saving it for when i am deep in the depths of production on this long video, so i have something to release. i hope that answers your question\n<!--\n</font></h3></br></br><h3> <font color=#1EFF45>6.16.16&nbsp;\n4:27 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=#0C9AFF> Is there coming a new big video out soon like the history of japan? or nah?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i am heavily divided right now. history and/or research videos is enormously important, and i want to do as many as possible, but also releasing a huge amount of songs (including ones in the 2 or 3 minute range) is something i have been working toward for most of my life. (i spent all of 2012 and 2013 writing!) so if i don't figure that out soon, my life will explode. But i also don't want to drop the research/history thing, because it is also very important to me, and i know many many people are also eagerly awaiting it. i am trying to figure out how to not fragment my career. yesterday i actually started writing a research/history video, and i am very confident in where it's going, but i am also gravely aware that if i don't jump seriously into recording songs in large quantities, i may die. that being said, i have a 1 minute song all set with video that will be coming out next week, which might help kick things off. i'm really not sure if i'm going to push full speed ahead with this history video now, or try to push forward with songs, or whatever. reaching this decision is exactly what i will be doing for the next couple days. it is very precarious-->\n\n\n\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n\n<br></quoteaco></quotequestion>",

Unfortunately, these annotations are Only available on youtube, meaning the downloadable version on your website is \"More False,\" and therefore to some, \"Not As Good.\" But, I enjoy having a version on my computer! You may have considered some options to prevent a situation where you have to add annotations, but have you considered-\nReleasing a version that you're satisfied with to the people who read this \"estqunois\" page, so that they can catch the things you might not have, and then incorporating those edits into a \"Final Version\" that you upload to youtube? I know you're not sure about collaborations, but but adding the annotations was a \"Collaboration\" of sorts; And, you seem to be accustomed to the input of the \"people\" on this page already.

Everything after graphics (score, jingles, narration, labels, troubleshoot, etc etc) for history of japan took a total of 30 days. so even if i finish graphics by thursday (wildly impossible) i would have to complete what was 30 days (for a 9 min vid) in 13 days (for a 19 min vid.) so basically that would require more than a 4x speed improvement from what i was doing in dec/jan last year on japan. but, graphics so far has generally been running at 2x speed from last year. i don't know how that's possible. maybe because i'm not trying to make vines every day? not really sure how to account for it, but i guess i have more experience now<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">11.13.16&nbsp;\n6:06 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> I think I'm getting it.

the reason this video might take a while because of your other job during the week, or are the days you work on the video, solely for the video and work vice-versa?(I hope to god that made

started<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">10.6.16&nbsp;\n9:09 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> what progress have you made on the video today?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today had some very intense setbacks and yet very intense progress. lately as i've shifted into the beginning stages of production (from writing) the looming magnitude of this project has intensified even more, which is hard to even imagine considering it was already unimaginably intense (the research and writing actually took 12 weeks.) there are endless new challenges, and i saw some particularly technical ones today, relating to processing power, etc. i will need to make small comprimises across the board in order to do anything at a respectable pace. that's about all i can say without going into detail. on the other hand, i had some victories content wise, regarding re-writes and trims. at what is now 5:56, this point was at 7:15 in the first draft. this is good news because i was concerned that the original 22 min draft not only had some tedious and tiresome parts, but it is also not reasonable to ever expect to finish the video if it is that long. getting into the swing of these re-writes, the prospect looks good for actually bringing this endlessly long thing down to a still-very-long but very swift and exciting adventure, and also be feasibly finishable by the end of the decade<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">10.6.16&nbsp;\n1:26 am</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> When you say too long (referring to the video your

seconds within the first 6 minutes, and i hope to continue tightening it at an equal or better pace, while also adding more information, which i understand is a paradox<br><br><h3> <font

stages are in the creation of your video? </font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i guess the major stages for the last one (and it worked very well) was: write, plan, graphics, narr, jingles, score. the 'plan' stage is sort of ambiguous, and a lot of the graphic work actually gets done during that stage, it's basically like figuring out how the hell i am actually going to display on the screen what i just said in the script, and it actually inolves doing a lot more research, like nailing down exact geography specifics so i can show them on the map, or finding the images of people, etc etc. the script also may change a bit during this phase, and i really hope it does, because it is too long and also doesn't include enough, which i understand is a paradox<br><br><h3> <font

country, sequentially, but that kind of linear thinking is just irresponsible for a human being with less than a 100 year lifespan. the japan video was just a prototype to see if i could do a long video in the first place. that opens the door to many many other possibilities, not limited to countries, not limited to geography, not limited to history. it's kind of like if you just bought your first 3d printer, and you print a baseball. what are you gonna print next? more sports balls? why not something different, like a car or a plane, or even a time machine<br><br><h3> <font

I'm not sure where people stand on this issue. i just can't take being accused of not doing something i AM doing, AND it is something i want to do. i want to do them both, so it is very difficult to see where to go here. in a way, i want to start doing songs every week, like NOW, but at the same time i gotta get this history video done. Even people who defend me say \"hey, he only wanted to make history of japan, that was a one-time deal. leave him alone.\" but it's NOT a one-time deal whatsoever. japan was just a test run of a much greater realm of the research format. So either way i am stuck. it's a lot like how i felt stuck between vine and history, before the history video came out, everyone thought i was an 'idiot' and 'irresponsible' for not following through on more vines. it's hard to figure out who is in the majority, and i don't think i should. i saw a content creator try to do a voting system for what the fans thought he should do, and i was honestly very turned off by the idea. i was thinking \"you're the dude, i'm following YOU, ... if you're the leader and you don't know where to go, that's not a very strong sign of leadership.\" so i generally try to stay away from trying to go strictly where the majority would say i should go. besides, if i did that, there's no way i would have taken the risk to do history of japan when i already had a vibrant vine following. &nbsp;so ultimately i have to do what i think is right, and i am extremely torn between songs and big videos at this juncture, but this particular video is turning out to be really large and epic and i think it is exactly what needs to happen right now. and it could easily take a few more months if i work SOLIDLY on it. who knows what may happen if i try to take detours and do songs.... that will make it take even longer, and imagine how much more intense the lectures will get<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">7.14.16&nbsp;\n4:16 am</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> You clearly don't value the opportunity you've opened up for yourself.

(at that point, i will also have a solid estimate of how long it is). the next phase is \"prelim graphics collection\", which would be finding all the materials i need to download, so in the case of Japan, it would be pictures of emperors and stuff, maps (even if i'm not using the map, i need to find maps that show the proper locations of the things i am mentioning.) A lot of times this means i have to do more research, because if i say \"and then they built a palace, right here\" ... i now have to dig back into the research and really pinpoint where and when that palace is supposed to be, and find the right picture, etc. This phase also can see a few re-writes happening, because i might notice certain parts are not hitting the way i want, or are possibly impossible to explain graphically<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">7.27.16&nbsp;\n7:31 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> when is the next educational video\n\n\n</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doing it now<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">7.9.16&nbsp;\n1:27 am</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> Do you anticipate acclaim similar to 'History of Japan' for your next video?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think it has a higher potential for success than history of japan did. but i can't control what happens after i release it. i just have to do the best i can while making it, as usual<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">7.8.16&nbsp;\n6:52 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> was the thing you said about graphic tablets sarcastic</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no! that would revolutionize my game!! to be able to actually draw stuff!!! i should actually get one, like, NOW, it could really come in handy for the video i'm writing now<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">7.8.16&nbsp;\n11:45 am</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> have you got a graphic tablet? got any oppinions on graphic tablets? reccomandations?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WOW i wish, you just made me seriously consider getting one. wow<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">7.8.16&nbsp;\n8:21 am</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> It sounds as though you'll be doing \"History of\" a more arbitrary topic than countries.

So that tells me that the total length of the video should probably be at least double what i have so far. If i can get it to work in 10min, that would be great. if it goes up to 15 min and stays engaging and interesting all the way through, i think that would be fine. Japan video was 9, and it took 98 days of solid work to finish it, but i was also doing 6 second vines every day for most of that time, which i am now not doing. also i have probably learned some things from experience and perhaps things will move faster. then again, this video might require many new kinds of graphics tricks. i am working as fast as possible, as always<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">7.6.16&nbsp;\n11:46 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> Do you plan on travelling anywhere anytime soon?

Also, i may have learned a few things from experience after doing the japan video, and might be more efficient. Also, my work schedule is lighter this year, so i have more days and hours available to work. i will keep you updated<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">6.27.16&nbsp;\n8:34 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> how do you feel about people telling you to kill yourself for not uploading another \"history of\" video</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that's silly, if i did that, how would i finish the one i am working on now<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">6.27.16&nbsp;\n12:15 am</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> how long will the hiatus be?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i have not been on any type of hiatus since 2012<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">6.26.16&nbsp;\n11:51 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> Was reading the other questions, and just thought, would you consider making a video like a few seconds long that's like \"I am making another history video\" Could be an easy way to get the word out that you are making another history video to 100k+ people.</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i've thought of doing stuff like that, and in the end i always decide not to do it. makes me feel like i'm not really in control of what i'm doing. might do the banner announcement though, like last time. but that only happened about a week before the end<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">6.26.16&nbsp;\n11:42 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> Hey Bill!

Do you think you're building a stronger tolerance or learning to ignore these pro-ad scum comments?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i have no idea. i'm working on my log off skills. i'm trying to write a video and it's very long<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">6.26.16&nbsp;\n7:19 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> IIRC you said that you were going to post your next \"history of\" video after 6 videos, between that reply of yours are now 4 videos released.

I mean you have over 13mil vievs on history of japan.

I never meant to only do one.... and i can see that people are getting the idea that i only wanted to do 1... which makes me want to throw a frying pan. i'm doing a billion of these. the other problem, however, is that i've been accumulating songs for the last many many many years, and i've wanted to do that even longer. so those 2 things are the main things that are ripping me apart right now. really really short videos, honestly are not much of a contender right now. \nso i am working on the big one, in the writing stages now, and it's going great. although it will take way too long, but that was true with the last one. and i still managed to finish it before armageddon<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">6.26.16&nbsp;\n5:57 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> japan was picked randomly. was the new topic also picked randomly or was it one you had chosen because you wanted to do it?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the one i'm doing now is much, much, much less random. it's exactly the kind of thing you would do after you've already done a test side-topic to make sure you knew what you were doing<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">6.25.16&nbsp; \n9:31 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> For the history series, I know you're not going to reveal the exact country you're working on now, but are you sticking with the Southeast Asian region or are you going to make the series about countries from any region of the world?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the one i'm working on now is ..... \"Different\"\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">6.25.16&nbsp;\n8:31 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> too many people are being disrespectful on your recent video.  what can we do to stop this??</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i actually didn't know until i started receiving questions on the subject. you can choose to do what you want, but there is nothing i can do about it. i need to keep doing what i'm doing, which ironically is writing another history video .... which i'm not sure if i want to do anymore, because most people who want that seem to be total monsters<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">6.25.16&nbsp; \n8:02 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> what if your next history video turns out to be a flop?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what if your entire life turns out to be a flop\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#1EFF45\">6.25.16&nbsp; \n5:45 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#0C9AFF\"> Hey was looking at the video you just posted on yt, and I saw a ton of comments saying stuff like \"why won't he make more history videos\" and I got really annoyed.

(if i can say everything i want to say in 3, that would be fine too. if it takes 15, ...... i guess that's fine too.) japan clocked in at exactly 9 minutes on the first timed run through. i am also working on this video every day, every available hour (just like the last one.) The main difference between this time and last time is this: during the 14 weeks that it took to make history of japan, i was also writing and creating short videos for vine Every Single Day for about the first 2/3 of the time i was working on history of japan. so that would be maybe about half the work time each day devoted to vine, and NOT the history video. Now i am not doing that. so that would be a significant reason why this video might get done faster. Also, after making history of japan, i have refined some of my techniques a bit more, and might be able to work faster.  However, the scope of this topic is a bit different, which might present some unforseen challenges. There is also a small chance that I may decide to make a short video just to have Something to release during the long haul (although i might NOT do that, because that will only directly delay the release of the long video.) The good news is, i have a 1 minute song and music video already completed which i am waiting to upload. i am saving it for when i am deep in the depths of production on this long video, so i have something to release. i hope that answers your question\n<!--\n</font></h3></br></br><h3> <font color=#1EFF45>6.16.16&nbsp;\n4:27 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=#0C9AFF> Is there coming a new big video out soon like the history of japan? or nah?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i am heavily divided right now. history and/or research videos is enormously important, and i want to do as many as possible, but also releasing a huge amount of songs (including ones in the 2 or 3 minute range) is something i have been working toward for most of my life. (i spent all of 2012 and 2013 writing!) so if i don't figure that out soon, my life will explode. But i also don't want to drop the research/history thing, because it is also very important to me, and i know many many people are also eagerly awaiting it. i am trying to figure out how to not fragment my career. yesterday i actually started writing a research/history video, and i am very confident in where it's going, but i am also gravely aware that if i don't jump seriously into recording songs in large quantities, i may die. that being said, i have a 1 minute song all set with video that will be coming out next week, which might help kick things off. i'm really not sure if i'm going to push full speed ahead with this history video now, or try to push forward with songs, or whatever. reaching this decision is exactly what i will be doing for the next couple days. it is very precarious-->\n\n\n\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n\n<br>"

But what I do is I compare the note to a pre-selected list of songs, and I can tell the note's pitch by what song it matches. It's not always snap-instant, but I can usually get at least a half-step around the true note.</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exactly, that's mostly how i do it. but, .... can you do it while another song is playing<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t And these songs are ones I have only discovered very recently. So my question: does being able to remember and sing a song in key count as, or at least approximate, absolute pitch?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to put it to the test you should try to get it to work while another song is playing, and compare it to obtain that song's key. but i will tell you something ironic. you will hear the experts say \"no, that doesn't count, that's just sonic memory. the real absolute pitchers can do it instantly.\" But for me, here's the twist: every single person i've ever met who claims to have absolute pitch, i test them on it and they fail miserably.... by way more than a half step\n<br><br><h3> \n</h3>"
