I think I might be able to convince him to cheat on his gf with me (since he was always really into me), but that feels wrong. I could also try to break them up by pretending like I finally DO want to date him, and then just use him for sex for a while. But that option also feels wrong. A third option might be to ask for a threesome with him and his gf, but I doubt she'd consent to a threesome with one of his former lovers, and plus I don't know if I really want to hook up with a woman anyway.
