But no matter how well I prepare I always black out and rattle on and on and say whatever comes to mind. And at the end I dont remember anything I said or if I made the point that I wanted to make. And then the feedback is usually quite positive. But still it would be nice to not feel like someone else takes control of my mind and body while im speaking because its just bound to go horribly wrong at some point right</qco> </h3><br><br>"
