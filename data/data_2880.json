How do I get my brain to use one of these lines and form something at least half decent?<br><br>Also, i have a very vague understanding of music theory and every time I try to write a melody, it ends up sounding more like an instrumental part of whatever song, so I can't use music theory to figure out what chord progression would work out best with whatever tune I just hummed out and use that to try and create a melody or whatever. It's just so frustrating having all these ideas and tunes but never being able to do anything with them. Pls send help.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
