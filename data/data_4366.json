Well, that's the story of my life right now. I have so many ideas and directions I want to go with music that I can't get anything done. Like, the other week I was listening to prelude to the afternoon of a faun and I was thinking how I'd love to learn orchestration and arranging and write these beautiful, epic symphonic poems. But I also LOVE prince and p funk and james brown, and I want to just devote my life to making the funkiest music ever. But I'll watch some of your videos and I love your score-writing and how you sync up music and visuals so well and how that's such a powerful tool and it makes me want to learn animation and video-making. But then I listened to some paul simon, and it's like, maybe I just want to get my acoustic guitar and ju\n st write\n  some nice songs. Then I'll hear some top 40 radio and it makes me want to write really fun, upbeat, catchy bubblegum-y tunes. But my first love, the thing that made me want to be a musician was blues, and there's always a part of me that just wants to just be a blues guy... I can go on forever and write a novel about the music I want to make, and I'm being pulled in so many different directions. I'll get really motivated to do something, until I have another idea that makes me pull a 360 and want to do something entirely different. I have all these lofty goals and dreams and things I want to accomplish, but I can't stop time and do everything all at once. More than anything I want to be PROLIFIC. I want a vast library of music. But I can't commit to any one thing because nothing stands out above the rest for what direction I want to go, and what I want to devote myself too. My compass is spinning around. I'll sit at the piano or pick up my guitar to write and can't even foc\n us on on\n e thing for more than a few minutes. I'll start working on one thing, and then without even thinking, my brain switches gears and I'll be trying to do something entirely different. Every time I turn on that sink to fill my cup, the water gushes all over the place and I drop the cup and it shatters and I'm left with a spray of water everywhere, but no water in my cup to drink (or to give to others to drink). I've taken a page out of your book and have been really serious about documenting and recording every idea so nothing falls through the cracks... But I just don't know what to do next. Do you have any advice you can share with me? I'm about to explode.&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
