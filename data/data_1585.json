I find it amazing how you can break this stuff down so easily.

Any tips on how to get better at breaking stuff like this down?</qco></h3>      experience with songs<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you literally rewind, listen, rewind, listen, until you've heard every note you think you can hear?</qco></h3>      do that when starting out, then after you've done 20 or 30 songs you will start to get what's going on. after 2000 songs you will even be able to predict what they do next<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or does your perfect pitch give you the means to pick it apart super quickly?</qco> </h3>      not even close. absolute pitch would actually be more of a distraction from anything musical\n<br><br>"
