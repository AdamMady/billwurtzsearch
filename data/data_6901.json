This is a very relevant issue for me as well, and i have some ideas that might be of use... i started out making everything in After Effects (i dont know what software you use but this should be relevant regardless) which is great and amazing but non efficient especially when you have a identity of textures and tones that is some kind of starting point and a through line through all your different projects but reusing previous stuff from other After Effects projects feels werid and is not ideal. i have recently been learning a coding language called Processing which i am using to create programs to execute visuals before i bring them into After Effects. For a a hopefully relevant example to you, i could make a program where i can type in text, have a rgb slider for base color of text, create duplicates of text on top of one another with differ\n ent colo\n rs and choose a display style like a repeating pattern of text or a silly wobble distortion or something. Then i can save the text as a picture or video and then do the polishing in After Effects. These little programs you can make for various reasons and reused without loosing freshness or constraints as you can easily add a few parameters to the code for every projects adding on to the base you have built up which you can execute and use immediately. The beginning of this process is the worst by far and takes time but it seems to me like the efficiency ratio is a constant upward line with no plateauing and from your knowledge of html from making this website, i think the starting momentum would not be too terribly slow. this might be helpful to you, thank you for changing the world all the time</qco> </h3>"
