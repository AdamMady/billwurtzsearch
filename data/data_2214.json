I know you say that the best chord is the one that supports the melody and that the melody and chords are inherently connected to each other... but I guess I'm wondering if you got any tips on working out specific chord voicings? I can come up with chords that I think are a good fit with the melody.. but too often I find myself just doubling the chord in my left and right hand (on piano btw) which probably isn't the best thing to do. </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it depends on the particular arrangement of the song, but what are some good ways to get around this? </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I'll play different inversions. Like for example to do like a cm9 chord I might play a cm7 (C,Eb,G,Bb) with the left hand and a Ebmaj7 (Eb,G,Bb,D) with my right.... but I don't know.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes that big full sounds good with solo piano, but it can be too much with a full band.
