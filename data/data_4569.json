On one hand, audio is extremely easy to /create/. On the other hand, text is much easier to /manipulate/. For example, easily skipping back and forth, seeing context, and (most important!) search.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, I use speech to text on my phone, but I have to edit it because it's fairly inaccurate. So, I want to ask, why did you choose audio? </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you deal with the inefficiencies of audio manipulation?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
