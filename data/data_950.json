Where as every time i have ever heard just ONE song, in its own special place, and in its own special context, regardless of what song it is, good or bad, my immediate reaction is usually \"WOW WHAT A GREAT SONG! MY NEW FAVORITE SONG, GIVE ME THAT SONG OH MY GOODNESS WOW, THIS SONG, (POINTS TO SONG) NEW FAVORITE SONG RIGHT HERE\" \n\n<br><br>"
