When you're ready, you could record most of the process (writing, singing etc) and you could talk to us directly like reality videos or/and add comments later when you can't really talk to us or wanna add more after. Then after posting the song on the different platforms you could work for a few days on the tutorial and upload it so you don't spoil the song/video to the audience cause they already listened to/watched it and they can be like \"oh that's how it's done\" while having a fresh example.
