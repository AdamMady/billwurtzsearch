I don't know your back story \n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I don't know you, but based on what you've said over the years, I'm guessing people (family?) forced \"help\" on you when you were younger to try to get you to conform to some shit ideal they had for who they wanted you to be. I'm very sorry that happened. That's not fucking okay. Sure, you're eccentric and unique and innovative and genius and \"weird\"... and as long as you're happy and you're not hurting anyone, you should be able to do and be and live whatever and however the fuck you want. Always. Period. I will fight til the death for your right to be as free and insane as makes you happy. But your needs and experiences aren't everyone's needs and experiences. Some people need therapy and meds to achieve basic functioning and baseline peace or to tak\n e care o\n f their kids or to take care of themselves or whatever the fuck it is that they need to do in this life... and I am clearly one of them. And when you think you're just hating on quack doctors, you're also shitting on the good ones who save lives and help give people skills that transform their lives for the better. And you're making people feel bad for not being as \"strong\" or as \"free\" as your online persona proports to be. It should come as no surprise to you that I quit taking my meds when I first started following you early this year because I thought \"if he doesn't need them, then I don't either!\"... and how did that turn out? Pretty fucking badly, I guess... right? So maybe just chill the fuck out for a minute and stop trying to convince everyone to get off their meds unless you're actively trying to get people to become creepy obsessive unhinged lovesick psychos when their brain chemistry jumps off the deep end. https://www.reddit.com/r/billwurtz/comments/9h5zc7/whoa/\n &nbsp;<!--\n qco--> </qco></h3><br><br>"
