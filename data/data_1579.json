    "html": "<h3> <dco>6.25.19&nbsp; \n1:35 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> I have this thing I'm creating and it requires a large amount of knowledge to complete. Of the tasks that need to be accomplished to finish this thing, I (at this moment) only have the skills necessary to complete about 20% of it. Due to advice received from other people, I've spent the last 4 months trying to work with other people who have the other 80% of the skills I need and as a result, I feel like I have wasted the last 4 months of time I could have spent working because I'm no further along in the process than I was before. Each time I find another human who I think can contribute, I end up moving backwards. \n<br>\n<br>I think this is because of a few things. 1) they're only focused on what they will get out of it monetarily (which is fair and also achievable with this thing I have begun to create, but their focus on money rewards doesn't accomplish anything). 2) they wait for me to spoon feed the creative process into their brains to fill i\n n incomp\n lete holes in the vision instead of trying things themselves. 3) If they do make anything, they protect all parts of it instead of submitting to the creative editing and improvement process.\n<br>\n<br>The world is telling me that at some point I will just find these people and that if I keep asking everyone I meet for help on the project, I will eventually finish the thing.\n<br>\n<br>BUT. I'm really starting to think that this isn't true and that what the OG creator is telling me is that I need to do this alone. I need to spend the time teaching myself to do the other 80% and then just do it.\n<br>\n<br>Now I'm wandering my house feeling angry that this is something I have to do by myself. I really like other humans and it's hard for me to believe that I alone can make something as incredible in real life as what I'm seeing and hearing in my head. \n<br>\n<br>Because this is going to take a really long time. And I'm already lonely. But I gotta do it. And I'm crying. Cause \n I'm scar\n ed. And it's so much work. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Is the next step to teach myself all those other skills? And then once I have an approximate idea of how to use the tools, I start making whatever the best version of the thing I can. And then I start showing it to people? Is that right?\n<br></qco> </h3>      yes but i might suggest not doing the biggest project first. things will flow so much more smoothly if you can integrate the doing and the learning. learn a bit, do a bit. try learning and doing at the same time. the part about working alone, yes, you are absolutely right, you must work alone. that part is true. i remember the pivotal moment my life was changed when i found out that some people are actually built to work alone and it's ok. all it took was to hear an important artist come out and say that's what they do and it's just how they are. then i started looking around and found quite a few other people who are the same way. many many people do great in groups, but, it's important to recognize that many people also work alone. there are advantages and disadvantages to both. disadvantages to working alone are insanely bloated production time, and your brain eating itself. but the advantages are off the wall\n<br><br>"
