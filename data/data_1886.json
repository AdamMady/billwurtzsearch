Like, do you think they would they just tape the show without music and Costa would do his thing? Or do you think there had to some coordination for timing and stuff? I wanna try to do some \"spoken word\" stuff with music accompaniment, but not sure if it's better to just record the speaking naturally or to do the music first, or try to do both simultaneously, etc.. it just blows my mind how perfect the music was in that show.
