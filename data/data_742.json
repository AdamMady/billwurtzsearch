First off, I want to say that I am consistently in awe of your music and I love how your videos complement the songs so well (and so artistically). You're one of my favorite artists of all time and I rank you up at the top in my list of favorites, along with the Beatles, Steely Dan, and the Beach Boys. I'm also grateful that you offer a place to share your knowledge and humor with your fans - it's a very unique opportunity to talk directly with someone who inspires you.\n</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;okay enough yammering here's my question:\n<br>When writing your songs, are you usually putting words to music or putting music to words? I ask because I see you also used to do instrumentals. I'm woefully bad at lyrics, and a lot of the time I'm not even compelled to write them, because I stubbornly believe maybe the music I create will convey the emotions I'm trying to express on its own. Do you make your music with an emotion/other goal in mind and then write lyrics to m\n atch it,\n  or do you write your lyrics and then write music to match? If you do both, have you found that your final products tend to be different depending on your method, and in what way(s)?\n</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks in advance so much for answering!</qco> </h3>"
