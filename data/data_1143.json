Whenever I try to strum, the pick eventually slides into an awkward angle, making it hard to get a good sound. \n<br>When I try to avoid this issue by strumming from a different angle, it completely messes up my form and feels unnatural. Do you know how to keep the pick from sliding into a weird angle, while still keeping a good right hand shape? Thanks!</qco> </h3>"
