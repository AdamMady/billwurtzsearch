Why is it such a big deal if i, as an artist, want to grow in popularity? is this the wrong way of looking at it? of course i love art but i'm not just doing it as a little sideshow, for me it's the main show. and this show relies on people showing up, to watch it. i think i have made my point. do i have the wrong outlook on this?</qco> </h3>"
