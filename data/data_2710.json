I'm college-age and have completed two half-year contracts as an orchestra (band) pianist on cruise ships. I've been eyeing the musical director role on ships for many months, and it looks like that goal is achievable within the next year or so. But I tend to be impatient and am afraid that this might take time away from my ultimate goal of being a composer/songwriter and conductor on land. Yet it&nbsp;&nbsp;would be my first directorial role and would undoubtedly be extremely useful in the future. How do I deal with this impatience? Obviously you're not me and i know you haven't done ships, but any insight into the music business is helpful.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
