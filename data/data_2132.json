So instead of finishing the song, I just leave it buried in the files of my computer and when I have a good idea, I feel as if my friends will think the lyrics are weird even tho I think the lyrics are totally fine because my friends are used to me just doing random or weird stuff and when I make something that isn't super \"randem XD lol\" and actually genuine like they don't ignore it but they don't seem to care as much about it and they're like \"waow something genuine? how strange!\".

Any tips on like how high the stool should be (like how high should the keyboard be relative to my body) and how far away should i put the stool (like half an arms length or something)? Or is it more just whatever feels right? Couldn't find much online about this, besides how to hold/position your hands, but I know that stuff.&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
