Essentially losing the first hour.\n<br>\n<br>But I got frustrated enough I said fuck it no excuses and followed your advice and I got so much done. It didn't even hurt, so it almost feels like it doesn't count because I've trained myself to view effort as painful, but whatever I'll take it and keep doing this and reprogram myself probably. Anyway, thank you so, so much. I didn't think I could do it, but I did it, and I feel amazing, and my life is going to be much better now.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
