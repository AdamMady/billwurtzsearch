I dont know if highhat+snare comes easily because of so many years of finger drumming and playing around with patterns. But now that im trying to actually learn to play drums i find it i can be creative in the arm area but cant really incorporate kick aside from perhaps a 4 on the floor or similar things. as soon as i try to perhaps keep a constant 16ths in highhat and throw some snares in there, i cant really keep up with kick stuff, i feel like perhaps my weight isnt well distributed and whenever i hit the kick i have to rebalance myself some way, any tips for that? And avoiding backpain when playing drums</qco> </h3><br><br>"
