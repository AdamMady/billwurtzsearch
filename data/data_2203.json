One thing I'm trying to do to get a better \"ear\" for music is to pick out little patterns and phrases and stuff that catches my attention. There's this one thing that I hear all the time... I heard that one Charlie Puth song, One Call Away, on the radio today. Towards the end of the song (starting at around 2:19 in the album version, not the music video) when he does like a stripped down, variation of the chorus he sings the line \"nothing on me\" and he adds this little twist that makes it sound different than the other choruses in the song. Like he adds some kind of extra chord or something. I'm drawing a blank on other specific songs I've heard something almost exactly like this, but I know it's something I hear very often in a lot of music, especially pop and R&amp;B type stuff. I can't seem to figure out exactly what's going on though, or what the little cho\n rd varia\n tion thing is. Can you maybe help me out on this?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"

Pretty much all the videos/tutorials for this kind of thing I've seen online are all just saying \"use this mode over this scale degree\" and/or \"highlight the chord tones.\" Which, yea, that works... But, I don't really like looking at playing music in this kind of way. Whenever I improvise/solo I try to base what I'm playing around the main melody (kind of like a 'theme and variation' type of thing). </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think when you're improvising, you shouldn't be thinking about scales and stuff, you should be thinking about the melody and harmony of the song.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, honestly, looking for work as a musician, being able to improvise off of a lead sheet is a good skill to have. I know there's a lot of gigs out there where you just kind of flip through the 'Real Book' and take turns comping/soloing over whatever song you happen to turn the page to. If somebody put a piece of sheet music in front of you that you've never hear\n d or pla\n yed before, how would you put together a solo that sounds good/interesting to you? Can you sight read the melody, but instead of playing the melody you're reading, come up with a variation of that melody on the spot as you're reading it for the first time? That seems really difficult.&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
