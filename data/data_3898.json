On 2.24.20 you were asked the same question and you replied with \"18\", which means that every 3 days the timer goes down by one.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t Tomorrow it will be 1.3.20, which means that the timer will be at 17. This pattern will eventually lead to the countdown timer ending on 20.4.20. Is this true?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
