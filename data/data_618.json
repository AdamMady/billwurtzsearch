The thing is that since then I've been heavily struggling to write lyrics to those melodies. (The album hasn't been published yet) I know what each song should talk about. I perfectly know what each song should make me feel (lyricaly). But everytime i sit down to actually write the lyrics I freeze up and nothing comes. I feel like I could have avoided this whole situation if the songs had been composed with lyrics from the first place, but sadly that's not how this songs came to life. I know that one solution would be to keep them as they are, without lyrics. but there's a clear message i want to express in every song, and leaving them like that would not help me to reach that goal. any advice on this problem? Thanks Bill, your work means so much to me</qco> </h3>"
