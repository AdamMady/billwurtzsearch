And, in the case of, say, the occipital lobe, even if the neurons never receive signals from each other directly, the lobe is still \"aware\" of what the neurons do (aware meaning affecting behavior. In this case, what the neurons do determines how the lobe behaves, i.e. what it communicates to the other parts of the brain, and so we say the lobe is \"aware of\" the neurons' actions. Same applies for part of your brain affecting \"you\").\n<br>The ABC scenario is a just simple example of this Russian-nesting-doll of consciousness, where higher levels are aware of the thoughts of lower levels, but not vice-versa. My theory is that, just as a human has independent parts yet feels like a single experiencing mind and not like millions of tiny neuron minds, so too may there be a higher level of consciousness that feels like me and only me, you and only you, Benedict Cumberbatch and only Cumberbatch, â€¦ , and perhaps some non-person thoughts exclusive to the higher-level-consciousness.\n<br>That's what I mean by everyone is everyone else. By the theory, we are all just one entity that experiences many localized, I-am-me-and-noone-else perspectives. Of course I feel like me, and you feel like you. But that feeling of individual identity does not mean that our experiences are not just the thoughts of one single entity.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
