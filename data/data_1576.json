It's something I've always wanted to do (I have decent piano skills, but never took it very seriously). I'm extremely lazy and my teacher is also useless, so I haven't been making half as much progress as I could have. I've come to realize that I'm never motivated to practice, and I've been wondering if I really like jazz all that much. I'm still more interested in singing, producing and arranging in other genres (things I've done before), so I could prioritize that next year.</qco></h3>"
