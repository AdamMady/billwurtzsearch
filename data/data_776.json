I know before lockdown it was all meaningless already, all i was doing was school which i was good at but at the end of the day i didnt care about because i just really wanna make music for the rest of mt life, but now in lockdown, i still have online classes but the meaninglezsness somehow feels more intense? and now i have all the time in the world because ive always found school a bit easy and i can finish homework relatively fast, but i waste all of it because im either too lazy to make more music, or when i do make music, i don't particularly like it. I have been hoarding instrumentals in my folders and have released none of them to the world. should i release them even if im not sure anyone will like it? or if theyre not ready yet? plus i have no confidence in my own voice, and so even when ive tried to record my voice for hour\n s on end\n  already, i still end up deleting it. how much time do u spend recording? ugh just i really cant get myself to work, and i have resorted to self hatred as a form of pushing myself, even if i know it doesnt work. any alternatives maybe? sorry for the rant it's so disorganized thanks for this parasocial relationship correspondence thingie</qco> </h3>"
