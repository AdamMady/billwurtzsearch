    "html": "<h3> <dco>7.23.25&nbsp;\n3:55 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> I was in a language learning Discord server at some point, and someone brought up a really interesting practice method. First some context. Suppose person A speaks French and wants to learn English, and the reverse for person B. Sometimes these people get together for \"language exchange\", which in this case is having a conversation in French, and then the next will be in English, and they'd alternate like this at whatever frequency A and B agree upon. The problem is that people who engage in this practice are usually not yet familiar enough with the language to make non-trivial sentences themselves, which greatly limits how complex the conversations can get. So it's hard and somewhat boring. The idea is that since these people need more input in their target language, they should just have conversations where A speaks French and B replies in English. They both get natural input in their respective target languages, without being limited in what they want to say. This sounds great on paper, so I'd like to convince the entire universe to try it to see how well it holds up in practice. How would I go about this?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
