It can be rendered overnight like a few hundred frames if you set it to 64 samples and then use the new 2.81 expiremental build. It has a denoising Ai engine from intel that does some absolute magic. See Cgmatter's youtube page for tutorial. But you just render an image and plug it into the denoise node in the composite space and then render and its removes the noise. Eevee still is definitely the way to go and there are plenty of other more important things to learn but i just tried this recently and it really is quite spectacular looking imo so its just something to remember</qco> </h3><br><br>"
