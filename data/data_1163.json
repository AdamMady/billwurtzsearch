I tried just starting really simple using the programs built into my computer. And my goal was to make a video of just a black line moving horizontally across a white background. I used MS Paint, drew a line. Took a screen shot and saved it. Moved the line the tiniest smidge forward. Took another screen shot and saved it etc etc etc. Tried stringing all the screen shots together in MovieMaker for the final product. Well, it took me an ungodly amount of time to do this. I had to make and save approximately 1 zillion screen shots. And the final product was trash. It just looked like a choppy slideshow of a bunch of pictures of a line. No fluid motion (which was my goal). I don't know what to try now. I'm super frustrated and disheartened. My plan was to learn how to just make simple shapes moving across across a blank background and then gradually move forward towards more complex motion and m\n ore deta\n iled characters/backgrounds... But I can't even get a damn line to move across the screen with fluid motion. I know I'm not exactly using state of the art technology here but if I can't figure out how to do something extremely simple on an extremely simple program, investing in some fancy animation software probably isn't the smartest move... sorry for ranting at you, bill.
