I've been listening to a few pieces in different temperaments but 19-TET seems to resonate particularly well for me for some reason, even though I don't fully get it.\n<br>\n<br>I've been trying to figure out how to use it myself but without a custom built 19-TET keyboard, it would be very difficult. Maybe I can manually write notes in a MIDI roll, but I want to be able to improvise. Even with one though, how do scales work? It seems to be still 8 notes, which I suppose maybe makes sense but then again does it and what do you do with all the other notes?!? Why do we use 8? Why do we use 12?\n<br>\n<br>I was looking into this and then I found Just Intonation (JI) again - yes I suppose it makes sense why we use 12-TET but why can't we use JI with modern tech? Can't we just change the fundamental when we modulate? Or, is it deeper than that? With JI (in C) does it mean that if I play an Fm7, it wil\n l still \n sound wrong as a C#7 would? I can't figure out how to properly play with a Just keyboard without spending $1400 on digital piano that does it for me.\n<br>\n<br>I think if our mortal minds could fully grasp this, then we would be able to create even more wonderful music. I think it's transcendental and we will never fully understand. Do you think? Or have I just not studied hard enough?\n<br>\n<br>Ahh I've been looking at this for days and I feel like it's at the very fundamental of music in general.
