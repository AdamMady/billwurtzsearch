I dont know if im being misinformed and am seeing things through rose-coloured lenses but realistically (this MIGHT change) i cannot really see myself living in city life unless something interesting happens to my internal sense of meaning that makes me entirely change my mind, which may certainly happen judging by the rate at which certain things in life are driving me insane. to the best of my knowledge i belive you live in a city so bonus question how do you survive (if you do survive) in such a hectic style of living. alright thanks&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
