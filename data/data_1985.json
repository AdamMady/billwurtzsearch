I have the main part down, but I'm trying to overdub other instruments (all using the keyboard) and it's tricky. I'm having a real hard time adding parts on top because there's no defined rhythm to use as reference. I tried giving it a set tempo, just really slow, and figuring out what the rhythm could be.. but when I do that, it sounds more rigid and stiff and kind of changes the vibe of the thing.
