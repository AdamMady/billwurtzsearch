All the albums that really are worth the candle and aren't just \"compilations of songs\" already do that, at least in my eyes. Take Daft Punk's Discovery for example, or Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope. Albums that have so many twists and turns that to share only one song off of it at a time is kind of doing it an injustice. THAT'S a sign of a good album - when you need someone to take in the total package rather than just a singular song. It'd be like taking a chord from a song and just playing that rather than the whole song;&nbsp;sure you can do it, but to get the whole scope of things, you need the entire track. An album should be like that, I feel.</qco> </h3>"
