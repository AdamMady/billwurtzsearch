There are really quiet notes in the first and second measures of the song (if you are thinking of it in 6/8) starting on the sixth 8th note that goes A D A D A. And the next time it happens is on the down beat of the 4th measure and the notes are G E G E. There are other times it happens with different notes too. My first guess was that they were harmonics because some of them seem out of tune but I can't figure it out.</qco> </h3><br><br>"

Some songs the verse or chorus ends on a melody note/chord where I can just go straight back home without any sort of transition or anything like that... but sometimes the last note/chord wouldn't transition right going straight into the next verse. Does this ever happen to you? Any tips? It's like a puzzle, I see the chord or note I'm on, see where I need to go, but then I have to find something to bridge the gap between.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
