They might seem random to some but I've always felt they are just specific enough to be applied many different scenarios, usually someone who is going on some kind of journey. Personally, I've often noticed transgender themes that seem to be present in your lyrics. In both And The Day Goes On and Outside you talk about changing your name, and When I Get Older has that lyric about changing your face. I've also clocked similar themes of understanding identity and leaving previous lives behind in order to explore things that are considered taboo in songs like Mount St. Helens, We Could Just Get High, I'm Best Friends With My Own Front Door, Movie Star, and It's Gonna Be Alright (I could list specific examples but it would take too long). Just curious what your thoughts are on this interpretation?</qco> </h3>"
