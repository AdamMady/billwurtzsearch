What I mean by transcending is difficult to put in to words, it's something like when a comedian is telling an elaborate joke, the crowd is already dying with laughter BUT THEN he goes even further that noone could've anticipated - like that but just in musical form. Whenever that happens, I often just pause the song and imagine in my mind how I would transcend the song, and then I end up wondering why the artist didn't transcend it like that, or why they didn't transcend it at all. Can you relate to some of this mild annoyance?</qco> </h3> Â Â Â Â Â \nmaybe they aren't capable of doing it like you could do it. or, maybe they transcended in a different way and you just didn't follow it. or, maybe they did not actually think they were 'setting themselves up to transcend.' so many different ways for this to play out, but the underlying factor is simply that we're not all on the exact same trip at each given time. it's kind of a miracle that music ever even connects to anyone at all. which is why i am hesitant to place blame when it doesnt, even if the 'problem' may seem so clear to me at a certain point in time. the best thing here is probably to save it for your own work. and actually the fact that you're feeling this critique, this can be seen as a mounting desire for you to make your own music\n\n<br><br>"
