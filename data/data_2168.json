I want to write my dialogue the way that people actually talk. At least me personally, I never enunciate all 3 of those words, I say it like it's 1 word,&nbsp;&nbsp;that sounds like \"wide'juh\" if that makes sense. How would you write that in a way that's obvious to the reader (I don't know if somebody reading \"wide'juh\" would know what that's supposed to mean).</qco> </h3><br><br>"

I've had asthma since I was a kid, and other recurring respiratory issues.. so sometimes it's tough to hold out a note for a long time, or to sing a full phrase without having to stop to take a breath, I think it might limit my vocal range too. When I do try and sing, I sound like if&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald Fagen smoked way too many cigarettes and put a clothespin on his nose. I love music, and I like to think that I am pretty decent on the instruments I play, but so many songs are driven by the vocal parts. Like, I think really the function of instruments in a song is to compliment/accompany the vocals (which should usually be front and center)... Not really singing makes it tough for me to actually come up with vocal parts, so I try to over-compensate with the instruments when I write. But when I do play with a singer, usually there's too much going on with the in\nstrument\nal arrangements and it sounds too jumbled/cluttered. Any advice for me?&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"

I feel happy and like I'm making progress with my creativity largely thanks to you. I do have a question though, I have two main passions, one is music, songwriting and production (which is already like 10 passions in one), and the other is sustainable food/permaculture/natural building/saving the world which is another several passions and my skills there are still so underdeveloped. I ideally I would love to connect the two but can't see how. Do you think it's totally unrealistic to pursue both of these very different fields simultaneously? \n</qco></h3>"
