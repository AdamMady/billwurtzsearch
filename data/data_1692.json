The part that I can't stop going back to over and over is when you talk about schedules, which are absolutely crucial for *getting things done*. Without them I've also noticed that there are just so many options, and you end up being all over the place, and one thing can go on forever.\n<br>\n<br>Now, I'm pretty darn good at planning and making schedules, but where I mess up is in the execution. I can't stick to my plans mainly because I get distracted. As soon as whatever was planned on the schedule starts getting a bit difficult, or uncomfortable, I stop doing it and switch to a non-planned activity such as reading the news on twitter, or some other lame thing like that.\n<br>\n<br>Now don't get me wrong, I really want to do the thing\n s that I\n 've planned and are on the schedule, I like those things and I feel enthusiastic about it, it's just that whenever it gets hard, I'm too weak.\n<br>\n<br>What's the secret to stick to the schedule no. matter. what.?\n<br>\n<br>I don't want to get old and be like: \"arghasdh... I was meant to do all those good things, but I was way too weak to end them D: ...I hate myself! \"</qco> </h3><br><br>"

Science actually becomes more useless the more fundamental you get, so a TOE would actually be the ultimate useless thing. There are many many things (in fact, the overwhelming majority of things in this world) that a TOE would not actually explain because no one outside of string theorists actually do science from first principles (deriving everything from quantum mechanics, etc).
