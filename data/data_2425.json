Unfortunately, these annotations are Only available on youtube, meaning the downloadable version on your website is \"More False,\" and therefore to some, \"Not As Good.\" But, I enjoy having a version on my computer! You may have considered some options to prevent a situation where you have to add annotations, but have you considered-\nReleasing a version that you're satisfied with to the people who read this \"estqunois\" page, so that they can catch the things you might not have, and then incorporating those edits into a \"Final Version\" that you upload to youtube? I know you're not sure about collaborations, but but adding the annotations was a \"Collaboration\" of sorts; And, you seem to be accustomed to the input of the \"people\" on this page already. There are a bunch of problems with this, but it would be an interesting experiment- maybe a shorter Longvideo would work better...? Good luck with the rest of the video.</font> </h3>"
