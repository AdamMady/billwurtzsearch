For some reason when I do go that low I usually double that octave but through listening to these clear examples i can see how it can actually unbeef the lowest note.\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because if the patch im playing with say has any vibrato, tremolo, or even chorusing or other dsp, by doubling the octave you wouldn't necessarily get that extra punch at the desired frequencies because there'd be way more noise (noise as in many more frequencies besides the fundamental, not really all-frequencies-noise) because of the nature of timbre and that could muddy up the low end.\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just realized my 61key midi keyboard doesnt go below c(65).\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When trying out the stuff you mentioned i put it an octave down and will be able to jam at a happier harmonic space.\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going with your Ab 52 example going with chord starting at Bb233, I like doing Bb C Eb G \n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and trying the second as u suggested with Bb 58 and C D F starting at middle c. Do you think you stray away from also playing Bb right below middle c wit\n h your r\n ight hand because of the most reasonable note to fit in a happy harmonic place within the context of the current notes is the root and its already in the bass?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying to reason out when 3 notes might do a better work than 4 (again fighting against my now aware bias towards more=better). \n\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought i might add some more chords to those 2 to practice and get your thoughts with a bigger context so this is what i came up with to get a complete harmonic idea. https://imgur.com/Dx5oEck  \n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, i'm happy with all but my first chord, the thing about the first chord is that I have an alternative way, by removing the Bb.\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like both but this is when my indecisiveness/whelm for possibilities/overthinking starts.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like the 4 notes on right hand as its the first measure and maybe it reinforces the one, but at the same time i think Bb could be better off not there for several contexts. To have a clear one, lets say we're singing never gonna give you up's f\n irst ver\n se.\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like Bb but no C. these would be the 3 variations im deciding between: https://imgur.com/3gKUMvN.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n I think it would make more sense to remove the Bb and keep C on the first chord and leave the 4 chords like this: https://imgur.com/mGJT4lj\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but tbh i find it hard to decide mostly because of indecisiveness and fomo on the other possibilities.\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Would those last voicings make the most sense to you?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really like the other 2 voicings but I'm not 100% sure of my choice of voicing it as Cmin with Ab bass (to make a Abmaj7) I was wondering to what degree would context have to change for those 3 to be usable or the most optimal for specific contextual situations in your opinion? Is my choice the most appropriate for a Rickroll reharm/voicing?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br>I hope im not misusing/abusing the questions page.
