Why have you glossed over the atrocities Japan has committed, which are major events in Japan's history? Examples include the Rape of Nanking, the South Korean Comfort Women, and the human testing conducted on Chinese civilians. These are important issues that cannot be forgotten. However, they are not present at all in your video, which has been viewed over 16 million times. This is encouraging the ignorance of the \"darker side\" of Japan's history. While countries such as Germany have deeply apologized for their war atrocities and engrain these events in teaching history to their students, the Japanese government has refused to apologize and Japanese textbooks are being revised to omit these events. I sincerely believe that you are a very learned and good person, thus I hope that you are aware of this and that with your large following and outreach, I hop\n e that y\n ou may also raise awareness of this issue. Japan's war atrocities are not to be glossed over. Happy Chinese New Year.</a></font> </h3><br><br>"
