Exercise, sleep, eating/drinking regularly and other daily tasks. I kind of get \"devoured\" by the project and it seems really difficult to keep a balance.

Are they actually the same, i.e, is the former correct? My favourite hypothesis is that one just forgets to add the 'always' until after the verb but it's probably something else to do with those specific verbs. And even stranger is that the following verb can't be something that you can do repetitively! Plus although similar words like \"dreamed of\" work, something like \"decided\" doesn't.</qco> </h3>"
