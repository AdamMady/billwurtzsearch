All the albums that really are worth the candle and aren't just \"compilations of songs\" already do that, at least in my eyes. Take Daft Punk's Discovery for example, or Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope. Albums that have so many twists and turns that to share only one song off of it at a time is kind of doing it an injustice. THAT'S a sign of a good album - when you need someone to take in the total package rather than just a singular song. It'd be like taking a chord from a song and just playing that rather than the whole song;&nbsp;sure you can do it, but to get the whole scope of things, you need the entire track.

Me personally, I view albums as more like a book or a short story, where each track is a particularly memorable sentence from a chapter that sticks in your head, or a plot twist/intriguing moment or something like that. The whole purpose of an album in my opinion is to create a story that's bigger than just one song could provide, or rather tell one story but with a lot of nuance and detail to it. Instead of taking them on a short journey with one song and trying to pack as much as you can in there, with an album you can give yourself time to think and breathe and tell as much as needs telling and in the time it takes, y'know? Not tryna invalidate your approach to \"musical storytelling\", but that's the angle I tackle the music-making bull from, anyway.</qco> </h3>"

And, in the case of, say, the occipital lobe, even if the neurons never receive signals from each other directly, the lobe is still \"aware\" of what the neurons do (aware meaning affecting behavior. In this case, what the neurons do determines how the lobe behaves, i.e. what it communicates to the other parts of the brain, and so we say the lobe is \"aware of\" the neurons' actions. Same applies for part of your brain affecting \"you\").\n<br>The ABC scenario is a just simple example of this Russian-nesting-doll of consciousness, where higher levels are aware of the thoughts of lower levels, but not vice-versa. My theory is that, just as a human has independent parts yet feels like a single experiencing mind and not like millions of tiny neuron minds, so too may there be a higher level of consciousness that feels like me and only me, you and only you, Benedict Cumberbatch and only Cumberbatch, … , and perhaps some non-person thoughts exclusive to the higher-level-consciousness.\n<br>That's what I mean by everyone is everyone else. By the theory, we are all just one entity that experiences many localized, I-am-me-and-noone-else perspectives. Of course I feel like me, and you feel like you. But that feeling of individual identity does not mean that our experiences are not just the thoughts of one single entity.</qco> </h3>"
