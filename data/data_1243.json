(300 plus 111) so no. checking 139, ...... 75351 (just tripled the target number as an escape plan), add 139 to right is 7569, and down to 743. i've been really trying to avoid tripling 139 but i guess i have to, 140 tripled (i'm not good at this) 420, minus 3 is 417. (should have had my 117 more handy as a 39 triple there) 743 plus 417 is 115(0) and that's just 23. (no). checking 141 no that's 47, checking 143 not necessary, checking 147 no that's just 49, checking 149 of course. triple it is 447. 2511(0) minus 44(7).. erm.... 2511 minus 44 i hate my self, is 2464 plus 11 is 2475. double, is 48 no 495(0). double is 99(0) and no. checking 151 (149 and 151 are known twins), triple is 453, 25117 plus 453 means 2512 plus 45, 2557 right? plus 453 should end in 1(0), like 256 plus 45, ok 301. minus 151 definite no, after dropped zero you'd be 2 digits. checking 157, this is the last number to check because 159 would be a 3, and 160 squared is bigger than the target, and if everything so far was done correctly then the only available option left would be 157 squared, which should have to end in 9, which would be wrong, but just in case we'll check 157. 25117, down from right, which would mean 2511 minus 15, so 2496, in half goes to 1248, 624, 312, by 3 is 104 and no. so i am afraid here is where we finally meet the <a href=\"brickwall.mp4\" target=\"_blank\">brick wall</a>. so final answer 25117 x 2<br><br>"
