But I haven't been able to ever make a trill on either a brass instrument or a piano or keyboard to sound anything but really really jarring against the rest of the song... In your song \"this is a song for my next album\" you end the song with a really excellent trill on a keyboard that just Feels So Natural to the rest of the track! I absolutely know that I should be looking to find the instrumentation that supports the track as best as possible rather than Trying To Fit something that doesn't belong (as like forcing yourself to shoehorn a particular chord) but I feel like at this point there's just something that I'm fundamentally missing with my executi\non of a \ntrill that always leads to it clashing Every Time.

recorded maybe 5% of the songs i had written, and then kept writing more anyway, and wrote way way more, then in 2011 i decided that the stuff i was writing was cool but way too insane and i should try to do more normal stuff. so in 2011 i wrote a bunch of normal stuff, and recorded maybe 25% of those, then i got bored with normal stuff and wrote more crazy stuff. and finally in 2012 i was like 'what the fuck is going on here i've written so much stuff and i'll never have time to record it all because it takes longer to record than to write and i keep wanting to write more.' so i organized everything i had ever written, and then wrote more. so throughout 2012-13 i wrote like crazy, updating and organizing everything i had written, fixing it, updating it, etc. and in 2013 i was like, ok, wowwww, now i really think i'm a pro writer and i've got so many hundreds of songs written. time to record it and maybe put it online. then i built a webiste. then i filled the website with all the previous recordings, etc. but then i was like, wait hold on, what about videos? i've wanted to do videos for a long time and i bet it would work, and it would be a good way to get people to pay attention to me. so i started making videos on a regular basis for a couple years and also making stupid tweets to attract attention. then the attention came. guess what now it's time to do the songs

deterioration of the telomeres that cap chromosomes, which means that eventually the cells aren't able to divide anymore, so they die. it's called cell senescence (and some cells like rat brain cells don't have this problem and they can keep on dividing forever). so it is possible that in the future we could maybe prevent death, by altering DNA so that the telomeres don't go bad. (telomeres shorten after each cell replication).

I make the notation in a notation program, and screenshot it. (then i actually make several alignment adjustments in graphics, because notation programs are incredibly finicky, it's easier to adjust things in graphics)... then i save it how i want. then i use graphics to erase the last note (and any chord that goes along with it.) i erase notes on a staff by just dragging empty staff over it. and i \"save as\" and then add a 1 to the file name. repeat, keep erasing the next note and 'save as'. then you have a stack of files all in order. then import. then allign the timing. it's the exact same way i do text, but with text i type it out and screenshot each frame, and delete words (easier, instead of erasing them). the delete technique would not work in a notation program, because the notes and alignment will change as you delete them. that's why i use graphics. it's not that hard, and i'm not even using a graphics program. just an image preview program, and i'm just copying and pasting boxes. the mccartney video was a bit more ambitious because i wanted to do a steady scroll. so i thought it would be good to make one huge image file that is the entire length of the score. and then do the erase per frame technique.... so then all the frames were huge... and then export that to a really high res video and scroll the video??? i don't remember if this was successful, but you run into major problems when you try to do huge things like that. processing power limitations, etc. Same sort of crisis occured when i was trying to do the zoom out on the japanese army. i ended up having to somehow break the task into smaller pieces. if i recall. i somehow succeeded in getting a steady scroll on the notation, only to find out that it was too hard to read when it's moving like that!! so i ended up keeping it still and then sliding forward page by page. if i had known the steady scroll wasn't going to work, i probably would have broken it into pages from the start\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#E9EC54\">3.7.17&nbsp;\n5:44 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#B387FF\"> is there a problem with this anagram?<br>\n<br>\nMy name is bill and I hate myself<br>\nfinish my disney meatball meal</font> </h3>      no\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#E9EC54\">3.7.17&nbsp;\n5:40 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#B387FF\"> According to a video you put on YouTube in December 29th 2013 you hibernated on November 19th 2015 or were planning to at the time.
