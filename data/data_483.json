(slightly perplexed) 'hmh, they got tired out.'<br>\n(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(eyebrow raise, slightly wearily/warning tone), 'they probably had a Big Day yesterday and the day before and the day before')<br>\n1: have you ever had a Big Day?<br>\n2:&nbsp;&nbsp;(pause) ................... my whole Life is big. (quickly looks to the side) 'oh, here's street cleaning'. <br>\n(the street cleaning vehicle sort of comes through the parking lot at an angle, and weaves between the two cars that were playing the game)<br>\n<br>\n ......... which, makes me immediately want to ask,<br>\n[both] \"Was the Street Dirty\"<br>\n2:&nbsp;&nbsp;(immediately) no i don't think so, (&amp;) i can never seem to remember. (1 nodding) (2 speaking pretty quickly) i try to remind myself to TAKE NOTE of whether or not the street's dirty, BEFORE the street cleaning car comes around and cleans it. ....&nbsp;&nbsp;but i always forget, and then the car comes, and i'll never know.<br>\n<br>\n1 ...... sounds like you need a way to&nbsp;&nbsp;predict the past<br>\n<br>\n(they look at each other)<br>\n2 (nods) 'yeah'<br>\n1: (with 2 nodding along) find out how to predict when the current moment is gonna be the past.<br>\nand then check up on certain details because you know you won't be able to access them anymore.<br>\n(both immediately get up, and start looking around)<br>\n1 (immediately) \"is one of these cars yours?\"<br>\n2. yep. i just bought all of them<br>\n1... how'd you do that?<br>\n2.... they ahh, .. there was an auction.<br>\n1. (blankly ?)<br>\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;online. i didn't have to go, i just sat here and now i own all these cars. .............. except for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those two.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(pause) ....... those are self owning cars.<br>\n1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ok, well can we drive some of these other ones?<br>\n2......... ahhhhh, nope, those are all self driving.<br>\n<br>\n1. ok, well then, ....... can one of them drive us somewhere?<br>\n2. Sureware.&nbsp;&nbsp;... i mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,,&nbsp;&nbsp;sure, where?<br>\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;i dunno, to the moon and back?<br>\n2. .... (disappointment voice) oww, i think that might be out of range for some of these cars.<br>\n1.how about down the street?<br>\n<br>\n2... (thinkin)...... sure. if you can figure out which way that is.<br>\n<br>\n(some hypnotic shot maybe zooming backwards (split screen or something?) bothways down the street, .. something hypnotic which makes both directions seem equivalent<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n1. do the cars know?<br>\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;the cars,.......... (thinks for a moment),.... these cars know everything, which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unfortunately cancels out and, so they know nothing.<br>\n1.(they) KNOW nothing?<br>\n2 (immediately corrects self) FEEL nothing.<br>\n1. (ah.)<br>\n2. they know everything. .........&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so they don't care.<br>\n1. (i see.)<br>\n2. ...... so it means don't ask for their opinion.<br>\n1. right. so [immediately pulls out some kind of megaphone device, but less annoying. something with like, just some nice delay/reverb on it, and a nice clean shout] WHERE DO YOU WANNA GO?<br>\n2. welllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll, let's think about what our options are.<br>\n(they both go and sit atop the business names sign)<br>\n1. (immediately, a bit soft, confidatory) you know just realized, we could actually go anywhere, and now i'm feeling kind of overwhelmed.<br>\n2. (immediately, same tone) i know what you mean. .............. is there anywhere you've been before?<br>\n1........ yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i've been somewhere before.<br>\n2. well can we go There?<br>\n1. i don't remember where it was<br>\n2. oh.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was it here?<br>\n1. yes.<br>\n2. oh<br>\n<br>\n2. are we there y-<br>\n1 (smile)&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;yes, we're here.<br>\n2. i'm excited about that.<br>\n[immediately huge rush of traffic on main road, surrealistically fast, in both directions]<br>\n<br>\n1. where do you think all those people are going?<br>\n2. (slow, blank stare forward) .. away. (quickly corrects self, and looks at the cars) no it's ah,<br>\n1. (also looking) ....... half of them.<br>\n2. yea, ... .....no, it's (they both suddenly realize)<br>\nboth: \"all of them are going away,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half the time\"<br>\n2. and the other half of the time they're ........&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coming back?<br>\n1. no.&nbsp;&nbsp;.. they came back first. .. then went away.<br>\n2. .. right.<br>\n<br>\n2. from where?<br>\n1. i think it might be a loop... (looking)<br>\n2....no, it couldn't be. this road has no curvature whatsoever.<br>\n1. yes, but they could be making a series of angular turns.<br>\n2. that's right, good point. (show diagram, with vague subconscious allusion to right angles and points, but not too much)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n2. (looking) everyone around here seems pretty driven. <br>\n1. that's just a sign of the times.&nbsp;&nbsp;...... 5 minutes ago, no one was going anywhere.<br>\n2. i remember.<br>\n1. now all that's changed<br>\n<br>\n2.....&nbsp;&nbsp;except we're still here.<br>\n1. i just noticed that.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;how is that possible?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n1. ... it must be because of this sturdy commercial signage fixture upon which we are perched<br>\n2. ... (smirk) \"sit on a sign, ... (looks at camera) feelin fine (looks back at 1)\"............. \"that's my motto\"<br>\n1. (stares back at 2).............&nbsp;&nbsp;\"my motto is different than that\".<br>\n2. \"i understand that\"<br>\n<br>\n1.(megaphone again) SHALL WE AMOUNT TO SOMETHING<br>\n2. well how do you propose we do that?<br>\n(the flow of cars slowly but fairly quickly peters out, like when the rain stops pretty quickly.)<br>\n<br>\n1 (looking up)........ (pointing) we could go up.<br>\n2. i don't know how to do that.<br>\n1. (looking up again)<br>\n2. that's the one thing, i've never learned how to do.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n2. i can do everything besides that.<br>\n<br>\n1. can you go .... to the side?<br>\n2. i'm pretty sure i can<br>\n1. but just not up.<br>\n2 right,yep. no.<br>\n1. (immediately, climbing down) \"these places--\"&nbsp;&nbsp;\"this has gotta be fictional\" (looking at the business names on the sign<br>\n(looking around, to the store fronts, comparing to the sign, ... pensive look, they both have)<br>\n2..... no, it's real.<br>\n<br>\n (a singular car drives by)<br>\n<br>\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......... is there any way to test that?<br>\n2. ............. try to make up something better.<br>\n1. ......................................... honestly, i would have spelled this with more 'R's.&nbsp;&nbsp;(looking at one of the business names)<br>\n2. (immediately reveals another R, of the same font, from pocket or behind back or something) \"here\"<br>\n1. (slaps it onto the sign) (looks at it, ponders it)&nbsp;&nbsp;.......... (takes it off and hands it back) \"nah\".......&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"i see what you mean.\"<br>\n(they both go into statue mode (like the walking budget got cancelled) and then begin sliding back and forth with hand slider motion on the side walk, not going through each other. ))<br>\n1. everything is perfect.
