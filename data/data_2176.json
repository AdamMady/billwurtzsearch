And for certain little sections in certain songs, I want to figure out a way to intertwine the rhythms of the 2 guitars in a way where it sounds like just 1 guitar, but with like a delay/echo type thing. Do you think if I play the same part the other guitarists plays, but slide the whole phrase forward like a 16th note (or maybe an 8th note?) that would kind of give it that delay/echo type sound? I don't have any recording equipment at home to experiment with.. but do you think this technique would work? Any tips or advice on how to make it sound extra crisp and natural?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>      if you are talking about live playing, i don't think this is a reasonable strategy. it sounds more like a fun/impressive stunt that would require a lot of practice to do it right \"AMAZING, watch 2 guitar players emulate a delay pedal, just by playing at slightly different times!\" not worth it. a fun stunt maybe, but not a good strategy. if you're talking about recording it, sure you could shift one track a little later and make it a little quieter with a little more reverb, but it would still be much easier to use a delay effect. very easy to get access to one. perhaps even easier than getting access to recording equipment, which is also easy\n<br><br>"
