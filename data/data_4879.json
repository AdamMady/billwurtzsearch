Condemning people as schizophrenic or messed up just because of the way they like to live their lives is an awful thing to do. I think it was pretty clear that Steve was happy throughout the video in his unpredictability. In fact, his optimism and his \"peculiar\" ability to find the thing and do the thing are what make him successful in the end. Do you agree?&nbsp;&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
