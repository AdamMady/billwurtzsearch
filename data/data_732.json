Then, as you sit down casually next to your melody, 'NOT' appearing to have any intention or desire to write the song, .... just begin trying phrases and sentences with the melody. don't worry about what's \"good\" or not yet, just start saying anything that comes to mind, with that melody. You will automatically start getting a feel for what the mechanics are (lyrically) of this melody. you'll see which kinds of words and phrases seem to always want to go in certain parts. and you'll just be internalizing the melody subconsciously, in the linguistic part of your mind. Then, put that aside, and just tell a story in your own words of what this melody is. When did you think of it? how did it make you feel? describe anything you know or feel about this melody and its origins. Sometimes you can even catch a glimpse of the exact essence of what the melody seems to be saying, even if it's the totally wrong number of words or syllables and has no physical resemblence to the shape or size of the melody. if you get this, definitely write it down. just try to PARAPHRASE (non-musically, in normal non-lyrical language) exactly what you think the melody seems to feel like it's saying. Now at this point the song will probably start to think you are trying to write it, with all the effort you've been putting in, so you will probably need an updated contract to assure everyone even more clearly that you are 'NOT' 'TRYING' to 'write' the song. then after that it's pretty much a waiting game. if you can stay calm and be patient enough for the song to forget you are trying to write it, that's when it's gonna happen\n\n\n\n<br><br>"
