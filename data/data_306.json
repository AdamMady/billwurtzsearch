It kills me Bill. \"Living\" life where I've given up my pursuit, my passions, makes me feel so absolutely dead inside. I know the things I want are achievable. I CAN take steps towards them today. But the trauma of my past has a chokehold on me. It's a cocktail of shame and fear that I'm not deserving enough. It feels like my desires, no matter how humble, are an act of selfishness. And because I'm selfish and struggled in the past, I still feel like I'm sentenced to suffer for the rest of my life. Dude, how do I even begin to let go of this? To have faith that overcoming this is possible? How do you pursue life again when you've been paralyzed for so long?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
