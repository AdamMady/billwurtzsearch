You were always very happy to see your tiny visitor and greatly enjoyed her company whenever she decided to stop by. But it very much had the feeling that she would come and go as she pleased without much consideration for your opinion on the matter. Typical feline. So very fickle. You can never make them behave like a dog despite wishing they would. Which reminds me! Later in that same dream you then had a dog named Vinegar! (The name makes me laugh for multiple reasons) Vinegar seemed to be very loyal and quite affectionate, but she also had a bit of a stubborn streak. You'd try to walk her to where you wanted to go and she would just stop dead in her tracks and refuse to move. \"She likes to do this. If I just act like I'm going to leave she'll follow me. She always does.\" But she just laid there, watching you walk off with your head turned around like an owl watching her in return expectantly. Vinegar never did follow in that dream. Ultimately you had to go back for her with a leash in hand before she got up with a wagging tail to greet you.</qco> </h3>"
