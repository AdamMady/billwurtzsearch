I really appreciate your work, and the way you're documenting so much of your process and putting it out there. I discovered your website tonight. I've learnt a lot from reading many of your answers on this page. Thank you for that.\n\nI get the recurring uneasy feeling that I need to Create Art that I need to produce something beautiful with my own hands.\nBut I am too busy consuming things instead. There are too many books to read, songs to discover, plays/films to watch. So much to learn. And such little time. Also the stupid but inescapable notion that nothing I create will be Good Enough, and other silly reasons that I keep putting it off like the decision about which tools to focus on becoming better at playing around with first. Words? Musical instruments? Cameras? I want to do it all but also sometimes I don't want to do anything.\n\nHow does one consume less and create more?</font> </h3>"
