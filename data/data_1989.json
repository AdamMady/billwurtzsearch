F# as a note would be much more common than Gb because F# is the first note to go, in sharp keys. where as in flat keys Gb is is the 5th note to go. so people are already more accustomed to verbally hearing the words \"F#\" than Gb<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know the chord name or even the note name will change depending on what key you're in. Nobody would say that Ab is the 3rd of Emajor because you go up the scale alphabetically and you don't want two A's (Ab and A natural)...</qco></h3>      that's right<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me the names of key signatures themselves, are kind of set in stone for the most part</qco></h3>      only when the choice is obvious<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like, if I played you a song in Bb and asked you what key it was in... wouldn't you say Bb instead of A#?</qco></h3>      that's an extremely obvious case.
