We have a flipped classroom format, so we read all the material and do the problems before we come to class, and then in class, we go over the problems. So, as required, I teach myself all this material and then go to class. And I sit there for one and a half hours, listening to at least one of my classmates screw up almost every question, discovering that some of them don't even know what 2^4 is. I mean, come on, Bill. Am I just wasting my time in school? I know that you at least went to high school (and partially to college, I think, I dunno), but you knew that (1) you learn better when you taught yourself and (2) you had nothing to gain from school. What do I do now? I mean, I've always loved school, but that was because it was easy for me. I never had to do anything because I always taught myself everything I needed to know. Now, though, I'm kind of yearning for a challenge: as you said, I wanna\n be somet\n hing, go somewhere, do something. I want things to change. None of this seems to be happening for my in school. Though I can't just drop out. What other choices do I have?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
