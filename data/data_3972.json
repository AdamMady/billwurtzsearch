I'm a bit sad because when I share my art, only the people who speak my language understand it. It has become quite popular among french speaking persons, but I will never reach international audience. I tried to write in english, being the language of the internet I think, but it's less natural, it just doesn't flow. I wonder if I should just force myself to create in english all the time (the more I do it, the more it becomes natural, right?) or if I should just stick to what comes out of my mind naturally, closer to the music on ma native language. I know the audience shouldn't be a goal, but still, I'm traveling more and more and I always find this frustration of not being able to share my work because of language. Any thoughts about my case? Thank you!!</qco> </h3><br><br>"
