I, iii, and vi share two notes, ii and IV share two notes, and V and vii are basically interchangable. I got into modal interchange when I started to feel bored with diatonic progressions. At this point, I feel like I've emptied my bag of tricks. This is basically the ultimate struggle of composition. People have been trying to answer this question for hundreds of years.
