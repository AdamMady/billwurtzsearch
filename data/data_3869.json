But I think maybe there might. Like, I turned on the mic and thought out loud it for 52 minutes and thinking of it being able to be as a standalone thing that's releasable. And I keep thinking but i think its maybe just a bit less tiring to do it without that extra minigame. Do you think that minigame should be the norm? that i should strive to be as entert\n aining/e\n fficient thoughtwise even when the mics off. Now if that were the case, wouldn't that make my aspiration to have every thought be content? Then how would I organize that, and when? I think maybe theres a benefit of only turning it on in certain times and be able to verbalize what has been inner dialogue only for a while, and that in itself can be an interesting display of words over time. \n<br>I'd like to invite you to be the first listener of the first outloud thought session. (the whole what the hell is a podcast thing rubbed off on me which is why ive avoided the word throughout this, i realize i have a similar thing with \"philosophizing\", its just thinking really, the proper way perhaps, although thats already adding a bit of my biases).\n<br>\n<br>I think not thinking of it as a podcast would limit myself to thinking \"you cant release 3 today!\" If i felt like recording 3 outloud thought sessions in a day. because that doesn't fit my idea of what a podcast is, and\n  that ma\n y bias the way i do what i do and how i do it or even worse, how i think of it.\n<br>\n<br>Turns out i came here to ask about why not release unedited reality footage but i really just wanted to talk about my first time doing something that felt natural since I am still riding that high. \n<br>\n<br>Hope you're having a bunch of fun and fulfilment playing around with your process and thanks for doing what you do and how you do it, i wouldnt be able to think doing whatever made sense if i didnt see you make sense of whatever you do.\n<br>\n<br>I'd normally go back and add parenthesis to afterthoughts but ive learned its more pure when the words are chronologically put where they are.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t Maybe not pure but characteristically something else.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
