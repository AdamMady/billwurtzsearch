Sometimes you say the opposite of the answer you really mean. I would ask if this is true, but I would have no idea if the answer you give is the true or the opposite of what is true. Apparently people don't always just say direct answers to questions and I don't understand why. Apparently that is autism, but it seems more to me like everyone else is the weird one for not just answering questions directly. And if everyone else knows that you can never know if someone is answering a question directly and honestly, how does anyone function?</qco> </h3>"
