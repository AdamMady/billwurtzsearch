The lyrics especially have intrigued me and sometimes puzzled me throughout the years. \n\nI've noticed in the past when folks have asked you questions about the \"deeper meaning\" to the lyrics of your songs you coyly respond with answers that read something along the lines of \"deeper than what?\".</qco></h3>"
