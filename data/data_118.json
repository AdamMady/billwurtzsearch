    "html": "<h3> <dco>1.11.25&nbsp; \n11:48 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco>   If light is the only thing that's constant every where in the universe, then why is it so prone to mistakes? Why is light affected by gravity so that we see eg. stars that are behind the sun in a different place than they actually are because of the sun's gravity? Why could we see the back of our head if we looked to the side at the event horizon of a black hole because the light particles orbit around the black hole? The back of my head clearly isn't where the light indicates it to be.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that the speed of light is constant makes it seem so divine, but does it have to be so weird then? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, if you fell inside a black hole, nothing might happen to you for hours and you would see the entire universe compressed into a increasingly smaller circle in your vision, the rest of which is complete darkness. Do you really think the black hole just swallows you \"away\" from the rest of the world or where would you go??? It seems like a place outside of our universe and I'm fascinated and confused because maybe some of my \"why\" questions could still be answered through math. Maybe we lack a dimension in our awareness to understand all this, but yeah I wanted to share my thoughts and confusion\n</qco> </h3>"

I know how to read music and I myself can play a few instruments. I find myself so immersed into music and I generate melodies and sometimes even whole songs in my head. However, when I try to put it on paper, nothing comes out, which is weird because I can perfectly hear every detail of the music in my head but actually notating it gives me difficulty. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is likely more common than I think, but that's not the main point I want to make. A common thing I tell myself is that \"learning music theory will help me actually make something\" and then at that point I have to wonder; how much theory should I actually know? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to sound like any other artist, neither do I want to be trapped into one genre. Self expression is important in art, and I feel as if an arbitrary concept will hold back at that (especially with something as highly regarded as music \"theory\"). However, I also feel as if being completely clueless about it won't lead to any progress. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible to develop even your own personal theory? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nI like emailing/asking questions to those I admire, and I thought taking this one to you would especially give me some sort of understanding.
