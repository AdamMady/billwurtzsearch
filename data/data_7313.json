Mixing issues, mostly: bass too loud, sibilance, etc etc. To relieve stress, more songwriting takes place, and at the same time, no new recording takes places because it feels \"wrong\" to move on until those old recordings are \"OK\". Somtimes, I get on a roll of \"just doing it\" (like what u said about demon-killing songs), and it feels so, so great! The experience stacks up, and slowly things start feeling smoother, it flows. But at some point I will always look back at the first recordings and think, \"that was a good song, but it's recorded terribly. Maybe I should go back...\" and that halts the whole flow. I guess there's no real answer to this situation, but I'm wondering if, besides the demon-killing, did you set yourself any \"limits\" too? Like, \"once a song is recorded, that's it\"? It takes so much willpower to do, but I guess sometimes songs n\n eed to b\n e used as fuel to kindle the fire of future songs. Or something. It's hard!!!</font> </h3>"
