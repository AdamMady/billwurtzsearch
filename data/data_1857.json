And I'd love to do the same thing. I'm not old enough to have a job. I'm still in high school. So my question is how can I make my life and my art central around my happiness and drive and not be worried about making money from it? I don't enjoy working for others or being told how to do something and I wonder how I'm going to financially sustain myself in the future and continue making my art. I'd really appreciate if you answer this. Thank you! You're the best! :)</qco> </h3>"
