However, one time i saw F11 in a book and they actually used it to represent Eb/F (which means Eb, G, Bb, with F in the bass.) in other words, F9sus4. I'm pretty sure if you write F11, it will be not clear whether it includes the A or not. I'm not sure if F11 is assumed to be shorthand for F7sus4. I don't think it's clear enough. If you actually want the A and the Bb, and the Eb, i would recommend saying F7add4. if you don't want the A, i would recommend saying F7sus4. F11 will be ambiguous on the question of whether to include the A, which is kind of an important question\n\n<br><br>"
