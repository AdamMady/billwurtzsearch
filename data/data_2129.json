How would you write that out?</qco> </h3>      well, computer programs actually sometimes do call it 24th notes, just because it's consistent, mathematically. But, ... in writing it is usually called some type of triplet or sextuplet. in your situation, i would prefer to call it \"16th note triplets\" for clarity's sake, although i'm sure people would just say 'sextuplets' and assume you know what they mean. i prefer to write it as a group of 6 notes, double beam, except only a single beam between the 3rd and 4th notes. so 2 groups of 3 16th notes, connected in the middle by a single beam. you can put the triplet arc (and number 3) over each group of 3. or if you want i guess you could put one arc over the whole thing and put 6. that works too, i guess. i hope that answers your question\n<br><br>"
