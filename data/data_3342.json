So, I'm a classically trained musician and started to play some Latin instruments. I decided to travel to another country to watch in person how my idols played. I didn't speak any Spanish, but it was super valuable to meet them in person. It took me two years to implement what I saw. I did sort of talk to them, and they did point out some stuff, but honestly not much. I did most of the analysis and implementation in my practice. Does that count as being self taught?</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it does, I guess I have some of that, but not with everything.&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
