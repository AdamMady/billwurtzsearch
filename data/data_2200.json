I don't know how familiar you are with Bob Ross' videos...</qco></h3>      extremely<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but his approach to creating art is just unbelievable. And insanely inspiring. In almost every painting he'll say something like \"now it's time to make a big decision\" then without seemingly even thinking about it he'll just paint a giant fucking tree or mountain or something right in the middle of the foreground, that takes up a huge chunk of the painting, even covering up things he's already painted in the background... and it winds up working beautifully. I know so many artists, writers, musicians etc who are so meticulous and who spend more time thinking about what they're gonna do, then they do actually doing the thing. Like when I'm writing a song... I scrutinize every single phrase.. is that the best rhythm? Should I use a different chord to harmonize this note? Should this be louder or softer, should I use this effect, etc. But if I w\n ere Bob\n Ross, I would just throw a big old wrench into the song on a whim, and make it work. ('This is your world, and in your world, notes can live wherever you want them to. Let's put this note here. That's nice. Let's put this chord here'). Do you think that you're able to approach your content in the 'Bob Ross way'?</qco> </h3>      well the important thing to remember here is he is doing a regular scheduled TV show with firm time limits. this is one of the gorgeous things about a regular content schedule, with time limits. things get done. and after doing so many shows of exactly the same length, you become very good at knowing exactly what is gonna work in that time frame. you know exactly how much time you have to do the sky. you know exactly when you have to decide on your mountains. you know exactly when to get to the tree highlights. and exactly when you'll have a moment to tell a brief story about some crazy shit you've seen in alaska\n<br><br>"
