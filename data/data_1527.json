But all this is slightly false because the numbers are actually supposed to be hexidecimal. which means instead of 0123456789, it's 0123456789abcdef. so 00 is the least and ff is the most. so 00FF00 is full green, 0000FF is full blue, 0000EE is almost full blue, and FFFFFF is full white. 888888 is grey. 995555 would be grey with a slightly reddish tint.
