It's kind of like my brain is trying to trick me into thinking that's not it, but the downside is that it does not give me insight into how to make it better. I have noticed now that it is very similar to what I would do when producing music and I would just add reverb to make it feel \"full\" or \"better\" and kind of ignore the fact that my sound selection and/or voicings and/or arrangement are not great to begin with. And now that I have seen this in 2 different worlds (visual and audio) I can't help but wonder all the other ways my brain has done that same process throughout life for me. Have you noticed something similar in your case? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mind sharing it?</qco> </h3>"
