I feel bad that the person is upset, but I don't feel sorry for what I said. And if I apologize to someone I want it to be a genuine apology and not just \"Oh, sorry that you were offended\".\nFor context (and this sounds silly in retrospect)... my friend had jellybeans and she said she did not like the black jellybeans and I made a very dumb joke that was \"Oh, wow, that's racist\" and her response was to get all downtrodden and say \"I really don't appreciate you calling me racist. That's not cool.\"....then the rest of the day she was giving me the cold shoulder... Like,ok, it was a dumb joke. But, obviously (or at least I think it's obvious) I do not actually believe that someone is racist because they don't like black jellybeans. That's (to me) clearly not a serious accusation of racism.\n</qco> </h3>"
