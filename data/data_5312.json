It's the commodified product par excellence, by owning the pants, you don't only own an object, you wear it and thus you make the object a part of your own identity, while you objectify yourself in the processus : at the end, the pants own you.

Indeed, where did those pants come from ? Isn't it the product of a bengali kid ? More deeply here relies \na critiq\nue of commodity fetishism : alienation make us forgot that we, as humans, are the producers of this pants;&nbsp;and just like the african tribes who forgot that they were the creators of their fetish, our production became our new god. No response to the quiet scream of the cow, just \"hello\", again and again. \"I wanna know why it hurts so bad\" : The ignorance of this alienation brings pain, we feel depossessed without understanding why, and when we see the pants we need to possess it badly by the act of consumption, since we don't feel that we own it by the act of production. We even have the feeling that the pants can \"make a wish come true\" : that's the final stage of the fetishised entity put above our heads. \"Hello sexy pants did you know that I like your pants ?\" : The commodity has become more than just pants.\n<br>\n<br>And in Congress all the boys get mad, and not because they oppose capitalism, bill wurtz is more subtile : the politicians are mad because they loose \ncontrol \nover the system, they no longer have a word to say in the direction, just like everyone, they become simple executant of the will of the Capital.\n<br>\n<br>While nature is out there, represented by the squirrels, all we can see is the omnipresent modern propaganda of the media, in this TV everything looks fine and nice, there is happy faces everywhere and it tells us to be friends, but in reality it's divising humans, humans are no longer \"friends\", they are actors in the representation of a friendship mediated by the society of the spectacle, in wich being a friend is just a question of posture, of \"friendly stance\".\n<br>\n<br>And then the capital tell you that thanks to him you can go all around the world, and indeed it became \"easy as 1, 2\" to go through the hills of France : tourism - human circulation packaged for consumption, a by-product of the circulation of commodities - is the opportunity to go and see what has been banalized. The economic organization of travel \nto diffe\nrent places already guarantees their equivalence.
