I don't know how many messages you get like this or how often you respond to them (if at all), but I just hope you see it. Your work makes me feel like things will be okay. I think it's because it's really about the good things, but what holds it up is the acknowledgment and engagement with the bad things. I was going to ask you to please never stop making art, but now that I think about it, that would be an unfair thing to ask an artist, so I guess this is not a question.</qco> </h3>"
