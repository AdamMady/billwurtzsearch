I was wondering: I discovered your reality videos last summer, and I kind of understood, reading some of the questions page, that they were old recording that you edit many years after, and post online maybe even later. I thought I read somewhere that you posted a new one every friday, but I'm not sure I understood right, since I come regularly to see if there are any updates, and I haven't seen new entries lately.\n</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\tWhat's the process for the reality videos? \n</qco></h3><a href=\"reality-search.png\">this</a><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\tI find them super super super interesting. I'm in the middle of a very very huge projet that I know it will work and I'm extremely excited about how it will turn out, but at the same time absolutely terrified at the colossal amount of work it represents. So I relate to those video you made, while you were working on HOTEWIG. (thanks) - good luck for your current projet! It's gonna be hard, but it's gonna be worth it</qco> </h3>"

Button components have 2 visible elements to it, the outer bounding box, and the text inside it. In typical usage, a mouse click within the bounding box triggers the action of the button. The click action can be associated with the inclosed text, the bounding box, or both. If the text has no clickable action, it seems reasonable that \"missing value\" would be returned, even if it is able to find the text itself. Automator may have incorrectly assumed the click action was associated with the text instead of the bounding box, or if your program is particularly nasty, the click action may be just associated with a certain x y position on the screen. Somehow you have to get the name of the actual button box,\t\t and script a click action on that box rather than the text.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is possible to script a click action to a x y positio\n n, you c\n an hopefully skip this mess, </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\talthough as you mentioned previously you would need to watch window size/position or create different scripts for different work environments.
