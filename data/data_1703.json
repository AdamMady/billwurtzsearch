The plan would be for me to spend, for each song, three days on the melody, then three days on the harmony, then three days on the percussion, then three days on the bassline, and finish with two days to revise and edit. Do you think this is a good plan? Anyway, love everything you do! Keep it up! &lt;3</qco> </h3>"
