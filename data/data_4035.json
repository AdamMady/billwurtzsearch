FINALLY A QUESTION FOR YOU do you think if you engaged in this sort of improvise-stack-more-no-precomposing-allowed that you'd let yourself get more weird and less polished or would you allow so much re-improvising that it eventually just became a kind of postcomposition? i am having some trouble with the bits of the improvs i don't think are as successful;&nbsp;should i allow chop-ups or is the one-initial-take rule a good one? i thought i could get this done faster if i hobbled my perfectionism by specifying ONLY spontaneous improv allowed, but there are so many ways to elude the spirit of that law and no external deadline requiring i actually do it any faster. what u think</qco> </h3><br><br>"
