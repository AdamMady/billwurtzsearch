I can't imagine I'd ever write that in a text message, \"Yes, hi, what's going on? Wanna meet up for dinner later?\"... Or even saying that in-person would feel silly... like being in the line at the grocery store and saying to the cashier \"Yes, hi, have a nice day\". \n \nSorry, I don't really have a question. But I just noticed that this was a thing (I think I probably do it too if ever I leave a voicemail), and something about this I find to be very amusing... and I am using this questions page here just to write about my amusement. </qco> </h3>"
