I'm a big fan of your music and from reading your answers here and watching the reality videos, I feel like you might have some insightful things to say on this topic.\n<br>\n<br>Essentially I'm writing an essay comparing digital music production to a \"selfie\": they are both ways of capturing a moment in time, who you were as well as the world around you, then sharing it with people around the world through the internet. I was wondering if you could share some of your own experience with this so that I could include it in my writing? I have a couple questions:\n<br>\n<br>1. Could you explain how your experiences and personality at the time shaped the music you create, and how did your music change over time as you changed a person?\n</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Do you think self-expression through music has changed at all with the advent of online music sharing, compared to before the internet, and if so how?\n</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. In many ways, the music you create is an extension of yourself. Is it tough to put your music out there and be vulnerable in front of a wide audience which can now comment and give (potentially negative) feedback easily and quickly?\n<br></qco> </h3><br><br>"
