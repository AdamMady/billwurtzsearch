For instance, my body can do a bunch of stuff like moving and maintain homeostasis, and also break down at any moment, and I don't understand most of the inner workings behind all that. Same with electricity, or computers, or internet. My life depends on all those things, but I have no idea how any of them work.\n<br>\n<br>How to not freak out and panic?
