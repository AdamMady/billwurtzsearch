I know and can play what each of these chords is, but I'm not sure where to go from here... so I make up a song and then work in whatever chords are not there, or do I start from the chords and make a song out of them? If I could I would just take what the chords feel like to me and how they work together and make a song perfectling meshing all their characteristics to make something new, but I'm not quite that experienced in songwriting yet, so I don't think I'm able to (if it happens like that, though, I will not object!).
