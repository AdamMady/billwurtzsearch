However, it always ends up stopping to work all of a sudden. I'm sure it would be plain to use the same formula over and over again, and I agree with your \"breaking patterns\" outlook when creating stuff, but whenever something like this happens I get extremely anxious and paranoid. I feel as if I actually know nothing about creating art. I feel like there's at least Some kind of deeper overarching pattern I should be aware of, and knowing it would make the songwriting process way more straightforward. I get the feeling that my \"gift\" for writing songs is only temporary and I'm bound to completely lose it one day, as it's based on nothing and has no solid foundation. I feel like I lack consistency, but have no idea how to make it without forcing it. I don't expect you to solve my life dilemma, but do you perchance have any advice??\n\n</qco> </h3><br><br>"
