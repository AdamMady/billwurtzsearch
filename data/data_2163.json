    "html": "<h3> <dco>9.27.17&nbsp;\n12:20 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> When I write down music, I always get confused about sharps, flats and natural symbols. Like if you have a note outside of the key signature and you put a flat,sharp or natural symbol on it, <a href=\"q.php?date=201705232021\">by the next measure are you supposed to assume that if that same note has no symbol then it's back to normal</a>? Or if the note is altered in one clef, but not the other, do I put a sharp/flat/natural symbol on just the one clef and leave the other one unaltered? </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if there's a modulation, do I put the new key signature in the middle of the score, or do I just adjust the sharps and flats accordingly? </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My strategy is just to write everything as if it's in the key of C. </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notes that are sharp I write the sharp symbol, notes that are flat I write the flat sumbol. I never write the natural symbol, and if a note is played with a sharp or flat multiple times in the same bar, I write the symbol each time (instead of just once). This works fine for me, because usually the\n only per\n son who reads my sheet music is me. And this system makes sense to me.... but is this a bad strategy if I were to share my music with other people?Like if I were to write something out for some horn players or a piano player or whatever, would this system throw them off do you think?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
