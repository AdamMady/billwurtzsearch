You often mention feelings of loneliness, and I wonder if this is actually how you feel, or if it's part of the self-deprecating humour routine. It boggles me, because you seem absolutely content with being alone, and I know that personally, if I had the chance to meet you or even write together, I would grab it immediately. As a girl freshly graduated from college and trying to figure out the path of sharing my ideas with the world, watching what you do is inspiring to me. So thank you for doing what you love, and thank you for giving it out for others to see. :)</font> </h3>"
