Nothing about the chords are changing other than the descending chromatic scale on the high E string, so this next unknown chord would have F# in it.

It's often presumed something's wrong with me because I remain silent, but I feel absolutely fine most of the time and I'll be polite/reply when spoken to. I only really connect with someone if they have the same level of social ineptitude or have the same very specific and intense interests as me. Please, help a gal out. Thanks.</qco> </h3>"
