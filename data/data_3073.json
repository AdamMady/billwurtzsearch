At first I thought that including lyric in those three was a little silly but then I realized that that actually makes complete sense. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theres a very real extent to which the sound of a lyric or the context of a lyric affects the song itself or the way the song feels. Sometimes the best or most important part of a section is the thing that someone says during that section (e.g. all the soldiers surround me and make sure I'm lonely)<br><br>Now, if one were to compose for a video game, that presents an issue. With a game, lyrics can be distracting, especially if they're in a language spoken by the person playing the game. So is music in games doomed to never reach the height of other types of music? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've also thought about using gibberish instead of real words in game songs, or just repeating one word over and over again (the Jet Set Radio soundtrack already does this).</qco> </h3><br><br>"
