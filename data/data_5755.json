I wonder why it's like that. anyway, now I've got into looking up other kinds of music theory which aren't a part of the western tradition and wow! it's so fucking interesting. not sure it's going to change anything in how I learn but at least I feel my horizons broadening. are you familiar with any sort of music theory outside of the western tradition?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
