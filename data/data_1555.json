Ive been trying to figure out what short form of what I was trying to do back then would sound like because I thought I wanted to try something new on my revisiting of music, but hearing those old tracks make me want to try harder this time, and starting small. Im just thankful that I still have those tracks around to experience my journey even though back then I didn't feel \n like the\n y were good enough for me to share because of the expectations I thought people had of me being the guy returning home after going to a great music school.
