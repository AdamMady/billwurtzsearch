(or another very low number of samples) if that's actually the case, why'd you do it that way? are the performance savings from only doing 1 sample that great, or is there something else you're doing to the video? a lot of the lines (on the pixel level) just feel..... oddly jagged, like there's no anti-aliasing going on at all\n\n.......actually just looking at the pixels a little closer, and i'm gonna revise my question: am i crazy or is there an extremely extremely subtle amount of edge detection being done across almost every object in the video? i'm actually seeing some anti-aliasing on closer inspection (indicative of a normal number of samples for rendering), but tons of edges are outlined with a thin black line. (if true) i'm curious why you did that for \"here comes the sun\", and also why not any other videos, at least that i've noticed (and if not true, what the heck am i seeing?)\n\ni think i've established that i'm definitely crazy, though, so this whole thing is probably a moot point anyways       \n</qco> </h3><br><br>"
