But it seems like you kind of \"made a name for yourself\" doing all the vines and short videos. Then you didn't want to get pigeon-holed as \"The Guy Who Makes Short Videos\" and when your fans came to expect more and more short videos, you put out HOJ and HOTEWIG. Then when everybody started demanding more and more history videos, you didn't want to get labeled as \"The Guy Who Makes History Videos\". Now, it seems like your focus is music videos for medium-length songs? My question is, what happens when everyone starts demanding more music videos and you become associated with this particular form of content? Will we see another big shift? Again, sorry if I'm oversimplifying your 'creative trajectory'. Like I said, I know you do all types of stuff. I'm a big fan of everything you put out, and you've been a huge\n inspirat\n ion to me as a musician myself, and as just a fellow person tryna be a person.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for everything you do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
