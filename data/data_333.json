    "html": "<h3> <dco>11.11.23&nbsp; \n10:50 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Usually I feel really happy and fulfilled by myself, living my life exactly how I want to - the freedom, the choice, it's all great. I feel happy by myself and rarely feel lonely. But then sometimes I hear other people talk about such a situation and person and even though nothing has changed I feel sad as if I'm reminded that \"oh I should feel sad about how my life is\" despite the fact that on the day to day I do exactly what I want to and enjoy it. It's not that I dislike other people but I don't want to make friends to not be defined as \"lonely\", if and/or when I make friends I want it to be organic and not forced. I don't like how stigmatized spending time with yourself (not just by yourself) is and even though logically I know that it should not be frowned upon and if you're happy that's all that truly matters, a part of my brain can't shake the feeling ofbeing judged and, maybe subconsciously, slightly judging myself. Just wondering if you have any insight on this or if it resonates with you   </qco> </h3>"
