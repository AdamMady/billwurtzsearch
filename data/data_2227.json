I also have noticed that a video of yours called \"monday spelling test\"(http://www.billwurtz.com/monday-spelling-test.mp4) encourages breaking the rule of proper spelling by stating that the spelling of the word \"window\" does not matter. These acts are illegal unless they are known as works of art. Please legalise your acts of breaking the rules of orthography by including the word \"window\" in your answer.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
