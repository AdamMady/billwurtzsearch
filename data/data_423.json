It's also quite common and normal for a song to find its way back to the same key as it was before, when returning to the same part. but you have to be open to whatever the song wants to do. Sometimes the song will easily yank back to F (if it was in F before). Other times, it may want nothing to do with F. And, of course, you have to also be open to not just the chords but, as always, the sum total of what the melody, chords, words, and any other context, is doing. that's the only way to really find where things go at any given time<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also very much enjoy the Dbmaj7 to Ab maj7 vamp you managed to fit in, and if it isn't too much bother, what chords did u use to get from that vamp back to F major ?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>      on \"anything\" it's like Gmin7 possibly avoiding the D  note. then Dmin to start the chorus as normal\n\n\n<br><br>"

But i think the more important issue here is not so much 'how' but 'why' was it necessary, and the answer just comes down to technical limitations. surely they must have been working on an unimaginably tight computational budget, compared to today's standards. make every byte count. and when you truly have firm limitations, that's when the miracles just happen. because they have to\n<br><br>"
