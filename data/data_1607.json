    "html": "<h3> <dco>5.16.19&nbsp; \n3:41 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> It occurs to me that the confusion over the idea of an 'album' is down to a lack of agreement with regards to definition. I think you take the term 'album' quite literally, almost as the term photo album, i.e. a repository for a set of only loosely connected items. Most of the people arguing in favour of a Bill Wurtz album see the album in general as a sophisticated artwork that, in its most successful cases, has not a single note or word out of place and was conceived as a thematic whole, like a novel or a movie, and not as a random selection of songs. All the great albums are apparently random selections of songs, that reveal their inner logic and consistency only gradually, sometimes after many years. Pet Sounds and Rubber Soul fall into this category. You yourself have already made one total masterpiece of an album. Its most satisfying tracklisting (for me) runs as follows:\n<br>\n<br>1) Alphabet Shuffle\n<br>2) Outside\n<br>3) And The Day Goes O\n n\n<br>4\n ) at The Airport Terminal\n<br>5) Slow Down\n<br>6) Hallelujah\n<br>7) Hello Sexy Pants\n<br>8) Mount St Helens\n<br>9) La De Da De Da De Da De Day Oh\n<br>10) Long Long Journey\n<br>11) I'm Best Friends With My Own Front Door\n<br>12) When I Get Older\n<br>13) The Moon Is Made Of Cheese\n<br>\n<br>The new album is also shaping up well ( Might Quit, Just Did A Bad Thing). I'm also not overlooking Christmas Isn't Real: it is my personal favourite of all your songs, but perhaps too high-concept to integrate easily into an album.\n<br>\n<br>You have lifted the single song and video package onto the level of art form almost single-handedly. Pity us older music lovers who are still attached to our 45 minute programs, preferably broken into two halves. The album was our guiding principle, our mainstay, our educator and friend. No movie or novel (or music video) could ever approximate its awesome depth and breadth of vision. Only the truly great managed to master it as an art form, most crashed inexorably on its treacherous cliffs. Indeed, if you set out to create an album as a work of art you may already have shipwrecked. Its easily the most confounding mainstream modern artistic discipline. It's a shame it is really dying. Perhaps it is already dead?&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
