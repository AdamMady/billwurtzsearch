What do you have to learn?\n</qco></h3>      the core software that i was using for video production was discontinued, actually around 2012 (before i even started using it). but by the time i found out, i was already 2 or 3 years down the road of experience with it. so i was clinging to an old computer system, year after year, and couldn't update or i would have to relearn all the tricks and techniques i had accumulated. But, there's also a secondary piece of software that i've been using in addition, ever since about 2016, to do some of the 3D elements, and sometime last year when starting on a music video i just felt deep inside that i wanted to try starting off the entire video from the 3D program, just to see what happens. i've always known 3D is a nightmare mindfuck timesink, but something must have clicked in my biological timeclock or something, and i realized it was my destiny to just jump into it, and apply all the same principles of brutal simplicity that had allowed me first enter the video making realm (an equally impossible mindfuck, back then, having had no experience). So i fell hopelessly in love with this new realm, despite some of the unthinkable challenges, and then it occured to me that this is obviously the time when i am supposed to make the jump to a new system. there is literally every reason to do it, and equally many reasons 'not' to 'not' do it. it's kind of like going through puberty. your body says it's time to change and the change happens. and let's just say that the transition has set into motion so many more ridiculous and exciting developments than i had ever could have expected, and yet needed so desperetly all along. it's like when a tree grows for 10 years under a small shelf and then the shelf breaks and the tree suddenly explodes in an upward direction. could be awkward at first but you know it's gotta happen. if you've known me, you'll know i've been through this many times before <h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks</qco> </h3>      \n<br><br>"
