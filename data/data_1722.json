Or do you simply not care?</qco> </h3>      we are living in a time where there is more agreement about tuning than ever before. because everything's digital, and programs default to 440. most people are pitch correcting their vocals, and it would be 440. even just 30 years ago, things were all over the place because things were on tape, and the speed could get changed either deliberately or not. my decision to stay in tune with the rest of the world is actually mostly out of convenience for other musicians. it happens to be very convenient that almost everything is 440, because if you have an instrument in your hand you can play along with anything. and when that old tape tune comes on that's out of key, you basically can't play to it unless you feel like re-tuning. it may sound fresh to avoid 440, but it doesn't ultimately make a difference, and it is very convenient for all the players out there if i stay in 440\n<br><br>"
