That got me thinking about how the mug of an artist plastered on something is quite often how music is marketed, and that much of musical imagery is focused around the artist themselves. This is in contrast with using imagery that is not focused on a person, things that are abstract and represent the tone and feeling of whatever music they are paired with. Imagery is a big part of your music, so i was wondering if you had any thoughts on this.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
