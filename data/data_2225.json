I think you should switch to the pro X version because the magnetic time alone will save you a ton of time on your videos (you can also disable it when need be). I think you will also be able to transfer your current graphics to the new version of final cut. All this should enable you to finish something like the Japan video in 1 month. Although it may seem uncomfortable I believe that it is an absolute necessary step if you want to continue making longer videos within a reasonable amount of time. I am not an editing expert so I cannot offer you a tutorial. But if the tutorials on youtube don't help I'm sure one of your fans would be willing to help you over email on a step by step basis if you like. Would you be willing to consider it?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
