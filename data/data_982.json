I just found out about you around the time that disease season became a thing, and experiencing what you have created and reading the questions page has been very meaningful and enjoyable to me in a bunch of ways. I guess what I am saying is I would ride with you through the pelican ages to the muskrat millennium, even if there are failures along the way. Even if there are other long periods of working on stuff other than content. Thanks for your work and for being you. I suspect lots of others feel the same but maybe you don't hear it because they don't want to bug you. The dear folks who ask when the new video is coming might also mean the same thing, now that I think about it. Oops, no question, sorry!</qco> </h3><br><br>"
