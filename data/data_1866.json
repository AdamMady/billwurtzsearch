He was all like \"you know, it's so great to see a young person who likes REAL music and not all that crap you hear on the radio today... Hip hop and rap and pop aren't music... etc etc etc\" And this guy's so happy that he met someone (me) who he can \"nerd out\" with and gush about all of his favorite music and stuff.... But, how can I tell this guy that just because I like some of that \"classic rock\" stuff, doesn't mean that I don't also like the music I hear on the radio today, and (even though I don't like genres) most of the music in listen to probably wouldn't be called \"rock\" by most people. I feel I've reached the point of no return and it's too late for me to admit that I like a lot of the music he loves hating on. I'm fine talking about the bands we both like, but I get really uncomfortable when the conversation turns to bash\n ing mode\n rn artists and non-rock music. And he always tries to rope me into talking about hating music that's not rock music from the 60s and 70s.</qco> </h3>      did you tell him about the scientific studies which proved the rolling stones music was evil and detrimental to the work place\n<br><br>"
