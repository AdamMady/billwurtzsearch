I'm having severe issues with the VAST amounts of \n<br>misinformation being spread mainly by vox populi and youtube/internet articles regarding music education.\n<br>It's driving me nuts. One of the worst (and I tend to disagree on a lot of things), I think, it's about \n<br>the myth regarding strength and exercise needed to play an instrument, as if playing guitar, \n<br>piano or even drums required some sort of strong physical competence to the extent professional \n<br>athletes do. I truly believe that playing and instruments in general (save some occasions and styles like\n<br>flamenco or extreme metal, perhaps) are learned through very simple principles applied through musical \n<br>concepts (or just music), with just standard physical well being (in the majority of cases already \n<br>achieved) regardless of gender, ethnicity and to some extent age (and there tons of exceptions to my \n<br>favor to th\n is too!!\n  But let's play). I'm seeing people getting hurt trying to get better at their \n<br>instruments the wrong way and it breaks my heart. I'm a professional musician and educator and I would \n<br>really like to have your take on this. I think you are a true great musician and am a big fan of your work, \n<br>by the way! Cheers! P.S.: Just in case, nothing against sports, exercise, fitness or whatever.</qco> </h3>"
