Earlier tonight I was walking home and the traffic light pole had its little trapdoor open and there was a power switch for the traffic lights! There was also another switch labeled \"automatic/manual\" that probably had to do with a handheld button similar to the ones you see on Jeopardy! that would have allowed me to control the lights. The button was connected with a 1/4-inch plug like on serious headphones audiophiles buy for thousands of dollars. That was so neat!
