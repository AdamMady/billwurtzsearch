For example, let's say the reason you are asking this is because last night you walked past a music venue that said \"jazz\" on it, and it made you feel good for whatever reason and that's what made you think that what you're looking for is probably called 'jazz'.

But songs with a 4-feel tend to just use 4/4 because it's all groups of 4 within groups of 4 within groups of 4, so 4/4 will always fit. I'd say about 20% of songs use some kind of 3-feel, and within that you're going to have a million different ways of writing the same thing. so those time signatures (6/4, 6/8, etc) would appear less common, but they are used for the same type of music which again i'd say comprises at least 10% of music from all generations\n<br><br>"
