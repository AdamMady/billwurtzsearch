Off the top of my head, I can't think of a song by you that ends in a fade (although I'm sure there's probably a couple?). Do you think writing an actual ending is typically the stronger way to end a song? Actually as I'm writing this I just realized that Mt. St. Helens ends in a fade (I think?). But I can't think of any others.\n<br>\n<br>I feel like a fade out could be a useful tool when you want to imply that the music could go on forever, but sometimes when I hear fade outs in songs it almost just sounds like the band is still playing and the producer just decided \"this is getting too long, I'm just gonna fade it out here to shorten the run time\".</qco> </h3>"
