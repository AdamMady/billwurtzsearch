Actually, i'm pretty sure that they will all be recognized as different no matter what. i've never actually tried to use 2 that are the identically exact same model so i'm not sure, but i'm pretty sure it would be fine. then, one slight problem you may run into, next time you restart your computer, if the keyboards don't work when you restart, just sleep the computer real quick and wake it up. then they should work. another side warning, if you do get this working, watch out for the binge-buying of keyboards that may occur as a result\n<br><br>"
