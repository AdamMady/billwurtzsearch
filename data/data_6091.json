Well, where did it go? I'm assuming that this means that everything was sort of 'separate' for a while, which makes sense, because a lot of the brain majorly either slows down or stops completely while asleep, and thus the whole is not there. But it's death that is weird. When you sleep, it can feel like an instant from when you fell asleep to when you woke, but when you die, that instant of being conscious again will (in theory) never come.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t You won't know anything, you won't be anything, and it's that thought that scares me.
