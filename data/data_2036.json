Just the idea of playing instruments and figuring out what sounds to put together baffles me, I can't wrap my head around it. I've tried to learn a few instruments before and played around in music software, but I still have trouble understanding how people can learn this stuff, let alone create brand new songs. Since you're so multi-talented in music, do you have any advice or tips I guess on creating music when you're in my shoes? Thanks!</qco> </h3>"
