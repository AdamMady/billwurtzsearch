    "html": "<h3> <dco>8.3.22&nbsp; \n9:42 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> A couple weeks or months ago i asked a question because i found that every cool melodic idea i had seemed to go with a chord sequence that starts on the 4 chord. And i asked for advice on replicating the tension that starting on the 4 brings, without starting the chorus in all of my songs on the 4 chord. You suggested i transcribe a bunch of songs that i like to figure out what they're doing. I went through a big playlist i had of my favorite songs, and what i learned is, maybe i just really like songs with choruses that start on the 4?</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went through 65 of them and 21 unambiguously had a chorus starting on the 4. Which seems like a lot. Another 15 of them started with a 6m into a 4, mostly going 6m 4 1 5.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't tend to write a lot of songs with that progression because i wrote about a billion that way when i was younger. So that's over half of the songs (36/65) covered by the two harmonic ideas i am already doing way too much. Of the rest of the songs, wh\n ile they're good, they generally don't have the immediate tension that songs starting on the 4 do. Maybe it shouldn't be surprising that different chords sound different. But it seems like the best approach is either to deal with all my songs being a bit similar, or to accept that they won't be exciting in the same manner as (for example) Everytime We Touch. Does that seem like a fair assessment</qco> </h3>"
