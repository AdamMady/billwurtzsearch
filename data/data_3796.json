I worry about what i should pursue and whether i deserve to or have the competency/resources to pursue to the point where its making me overly sensitive about my performance. I wonder if youve felt this and how far youve come in dealing with this. Making videos seems like a perfect fit for you, so I was curious what led you down this path as opposed to everything else you wanted to pursue. thanks,..,</qco> </h3><br><br>"
