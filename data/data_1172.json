I like to make projects, cool little events, sometimes a little funny video, perhaps a map to a video game and so on. But for years I've been struggling with three big problems.\n<br>\n<br>First, when thinking about starting a project, I tend to struggle getting it started. In my mind I have this feeling that I know exactly what to do, but starting it just feels exhausting and I don't get things done. How do I kickstart myself to start those projects?\n</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, when I get things started, I have this bad trait where I work on projects marathon style. For example, I do something for multiple days nonstop, but if I take even a smallest pause (like one day), the project just freezes instantly. How do I get rid of this marathon mentality?\n</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, even if things are rolling, sometimes I start to think elsewhere. \"Damn, that's a great idea!\" New projects that I should absolutely do! But there's this other project I'\n m alread\n y working on and that would just give me extra work. How does one simply focus on one project at a time while maintaining other amazing, potential ideas?</qco> </h3>"
