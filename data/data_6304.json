The video made me realise that I should definitely learn more about music stuff, so I decided to download a free demo version of some random music theory book today. The book thing introduced me to basic music notation stuff first. I was doing fine and having fun until I came across tuplets/grouplets. I just straight up had a short crying session because the darn thing blew my mind (in a negative way). Like, how are you supposed to divide a whole note into three half notes???</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A whole note is worth 4 beats, and a half note is worth 2 beats. 3 times 2 equals 6, not 4!! I'm so confused?!?!</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wanted to have fun!! I've even watched some videos regarding this topic, but I'm still not quite sure if I get the hang of it. I did try to make my own definition, but I think I might need your help with improving it. It basically goes like this: \"a tuplet/grouplet is a group o\n f multip\n le shorter notes used as a substitute for a single longer note (for example a group of 3 eighth notes can be used instead of a single quarter note)\" . Does my definition make any sense? How would you explain tuplets in your own words? What's the most important thing to know about tuplets? Also, where can I find really good examples of tuplets in songs? Thank you a lot in advance!!!</qco> </h3><a href=\"trip1.png\">this</a><a href=\"16trip.png\">this</a><a href=\"5tup.png\">this</a><a href=\"4inthetimeof3.png\">this</a>"
