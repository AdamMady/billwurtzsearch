But one thing I've noticed with these theory-nerds (myself included) is that they'll over think things. Sometimes a simple ii-V-I sounds better than a tritone substitution.  Sometimes a triad (or a two part harmony, or even a single note) works better than a fancy extended chord. I think I'm a much better player after years of studying and learning, but when I was first learning music I'd write songs much faster and more easily than I do now...
