I switched schools mid semester and uh oh turns out everyone around me is very experienced and skilled and I am not. I'm telling myself that I'll catch up and I shouldn't be jealous of those who've had more experience. But there's a little voice in my head that tells me that it's too late, I've missed my shot, I can't become good at anything starting age 17 and I should just give up. Now I can't say if this is true, but if it is please tell me and I'll just go back to studying to become an engineer, which is 1000x less fulfilling but at least I'm good at it</qco> </h3><br><br>"
