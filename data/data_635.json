I'm going through a song, looking at it's chords to get a better understanding of it and I want to go through and write the roman numerals and type (maj, min, dim, etc) so like I-ii-V-vi etc etc. Problem is, this is one of those songs that doesn't sit neatly in major or minor. It has one flat, starts on a D minor chord but resolves most of the time to F major, however, it resolves to a D minor at the very end. So, to the point, do I write the numerals in terms of the minor key (i-ii°-III-iv-v-VI-VII) or the major key (I-ii-iii-IV-V-vi-vii°)? Thanks so much</qco> </h3>      \ni personally don't use roman numerals because they make my eyes hurt, but, in terms of deciding whether your minor root is called 1 or 6..... it's your choice. it's like choosing what you want for breakfast, which i understand is easier said than done\n<br><br>"
