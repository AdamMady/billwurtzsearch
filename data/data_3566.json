And I don't mean it in a crazy person way of \"oh we were all made as part of it\" but I mean that that they set all the the weird laws of physics as a 'code' with all particles and waves here being represented as data there and then let the Big Bang happen. And then the classic question from that would be \"well who made their universe?\" And then I'd think that it was 'programmed' in an even simpler and more logical universe that has the capacity to create a slightly more complex one and that it would keep going that way until you get to a universe that's a hypothetical idea, like an exact representation of logic.

The comment then goes on to state that the video is told through Steve's eyes and the \"random bursts into jingles\" show how \"childlike his mind is\". The mountains are categorized as his mental issues, which he can't climb, but due to the mail (medication) that the girl mailman (doctor/nurse) delivers to him helps to mask these issues to help it look like they are working. According to the comment, he then states that he can suddenly climb the mountains, proving that the medication is appearing to work. The rain at the end implies depression which is the result of the medication not helping Steve. The weather forecast at the very end depicts that he will have this depression forever, and the final line, \"Bye, I'm Steve\" shows that he is not happy with life and kills \n himself.\n  I'd like to know your thoughts on this theory.
