It's when you're bursting with creative desire but for one reason or another you feel like a hopeless amateur in whatever field you're working in. you feel technically under qualified and under-experienced, for some reason. and of course the only way to get good is to start getting some practice, but you're so concerned that the first few hundred steps you take will seem horribly lacking and underprofessional. and so you get to work, and blame the avant garde. under the guise of 'avant garde', the low-brow has a chance to immediately become high-brow. trash can go on display in a museum. heck, if you can't get into a normal museum, make an avant garde museum, which can of course be made anywhere.
