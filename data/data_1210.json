While i'm drawing it stays connected, but let's say i do some other things (not drawing), maybe have lunch, go to bed, etc etc etc. Then, when i go to draw again, ok it's time to draw i would like to draw now please, ... it just does not work. I am specifically talking about wired mode (forget bluetooth). The only reliable way to make the thing work is to log out and log in again, you have to do this each time you want to start drawing on a new day basically. i am pretty disappointed because it is supposed to be a high quality tablet which is pretty expensive. The only other wacom experience i had was with the 2012 wacom bamboo which i was using on mac os 10.6.8, for years and years, and worked perfectly, always, any time i needed it. Besides this, another side note which i have learned about a graphics tablet is i think i have concluded that a small tablet is actually better. unless it has an actual display on it in which case larger would be better but that's almost a different product entirely, and a very different price range, more comparable to an ipad or touch laptop\n<br><br>"
