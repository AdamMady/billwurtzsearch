I know you're not really a guiarist, but my question is, do you think that there's any way to figure out what tuning is being used just by listening to a song?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was thinking that the tonic chord provides a big clue. You wouldnt tune to open D, but then play in the key of G# or something (if you're in open D, your 1chord will probably be D). But once you throw in capos to the mix the tonic chord clue isn't very helpful (you can tune to open D, but then put your capo on the 2nd fret to play in E, etc)... Also, side question, how does using a lot of different tunings work live? Like were 50% of joni mitchell concerts just her tuning her guitar a million times?</qco> </h3>"

For example, you say this to another person: \"oh yeah this song is my favourite\", and then instantly another song becomes your favourite.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br>Why do you think that's the case for you? please correct me and explain what you mean by those \"picking favourites\"-statements if i am wrong or i misunderstood you</qco> </h3>"
