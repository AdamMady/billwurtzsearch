If the strings matter the C is on the A string (standard tuning) and then the rest are just in order ending with the high E string which I play open in this chord. I think that it's some kind of F chord because I took the CFA part from the standard FCFACF barre guitar chord but I don't know what it might be called with the addition of that D and especially E. It sounds melancholy and strange but it's nice. Thanks.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
