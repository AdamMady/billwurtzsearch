(subbing the 4 for 2m also has a pretty darn similar effect) i've come up so many melodies that use those chords, and i love every one of them. i don't think i could make a bad melody with those chords if i tried. i'm aware that a million songs have used there exact series of chords, but somehow it never gets old. like, the bridge section in \"do the thing\" uses these chords and it's so, so fuckin awesome there. thoughts on why these chords always just.... work?</qco> </h3><br><br>"

My instinct tells me that if it's an especially intimate moment, a single line might work better, but Simon and Garfunkel's \"Sound of Silence\" kinda flies in the face of that thought. I feel that I would err on the side of adding too much vocal harmony, especially if that were my only role in a band, to sing backup. Thoughts?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
