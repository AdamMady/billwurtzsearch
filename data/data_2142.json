You answered that it was for humans to see what we are capable of. I think its a weird question to ask because, why would there be a purpose or meaning? I know some people need to have a sense of meaning to not feel completely helpless. But its like asking: \" what is the meaning of turtle existence?\". I would say there is none. So why should it be different for humans?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
