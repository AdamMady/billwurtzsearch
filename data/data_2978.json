I feel happy by myself and rarely feel lonely. But then sometimes I hear other people talk about such a situation and person and even though nothing has changed I feel sad as if I'm reminded that \"oh I should feel sad about how my life is\" despite the fact that on the day to day I do exactly what I want to and enjoy it. It's not that I dislike other people but I don't want to make friends to not be defined as \"lonely\", if and/or when I make friends I want it to be organic and not forced. I don't like how stigmatized spending time with yourself (not just by yourself) is and even though logically I know that it should not be frowned upon and if you're happy that's all that truly matters, a part of my brain can't shake the feeling ofbeing judged and, maybe subconsciously, slightly judging myself.
