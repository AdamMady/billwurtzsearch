My boss was like, \"I like for each volunteer to develop some programming for the students based on something you know well and love.\" I responded that I could teach music/music theory to the kids. Then she was like, \"Awesome. That'll be a great experience for them. But what's the practical use of music theory? Like in actual school.\" And... I did not know what she meant or how to answer. I just murmured something about rhythm and math or something. So my question: How would you answer that? Is music theory a good thing for non-musicians to just learn?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
