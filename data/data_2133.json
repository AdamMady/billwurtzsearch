And because I know \"C\" i can figure out every other note too(maybe I'm not explaining this right) my point is i can figure out any notes to a thing as long as I think from \"C\" first. I explained this to my teacher and he was like \"that's perfect pitch\" but I always thought perfect pitch was effortless.\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honestly it doesn't matter much to me cuz I got to where I was thinking I'm relative pitch so even if I don't have perfect pitch It's not like it's impossible to be good with relative.\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just wondering I you ever heard of this kind of thing.
