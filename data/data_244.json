Your works are nothing short of genius and I just want to say thank you, THANK YOU for posting these. I honestly don't know where I'd be without them. Your bass playing matches beautifully with the other sections. Listening to \"if the world doesn't end\" followed by \"fly around\" is like being hugged and told it'll be alright. I can't say thank you enough. Thank you for making them, thank you for posting them, THANK YOU for doing what you do. Your songs absolutely touch my soul in ways I can't describe and fill me with hope even on the worst of days. Once again: thank you.\n<br></qco> </h3>"
