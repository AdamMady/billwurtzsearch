Like he says \"I just noticed\" several times, and goes from being sort of flip floppy between \"some of the time\" and \"most of the time\" near the beginning to confidently correcting his new friend that its \"most of the time\" at the end. Is that what the receptionist was getting at when they said to go down the hall to find \"proof of self\"? Also btw the song is incredible, I love how it starts off as a cool bop and then around \"in the real game\" it starts to gradually branch off and gets unexpectedly kinda beautiful and magic sounding, then goes straight back into being all head-boppy at the end.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
