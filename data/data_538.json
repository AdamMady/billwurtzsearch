And i asked for advice on replicating the tension that starting on the 4 brings, without starting the chorus in all of my songs on the 4 chord. You suggested i transcribe a bunch of songs that i like to figure out what they're doing. I went through a big playlist i had of my favorite songs, and what i learned is, maybe i just really like songs with choruses that start on the 4?</qco></h3>"
