I have about 10 years of piano lessons behind me, but I still can't seem to \"just make stuff up\" I don't understand how some people can just listen to a tune and improvise something that sounds incredible off of it. I know some music theory so I can do very simple harmony beneath a melody that I've heard, but I don't know how to make it sound good or jazzy. When I try to mess around on the piano I always revert back to trying to follow the rules I've been taught but failing to turn it into an effective song. Do you have any ideas or tips for how I might be able to improvise more effectively and learn how to harmonize in ways that sound good and rich to me and others?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
