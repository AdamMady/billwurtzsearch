I'm comfortable with 7th chords and I finally understand the difference between dominant 7s vs. Major and minor 7s. I know the major scale (do re me fa so la ti do), and I can use the chords/scale degrees (I ii iii IV V vi vii) to build progressions..<br><br>But I feel like when I write, I keep playing octaves and a 5th on the left hand and major or minor triads on the right. Now that I learned all major, minor and 7th chords in root position, everything I play as a roman numeral progression sounds so similar (and not very great since I don't know my inversions yet) I'm vaguely comfortable using diminished/augmented chords or some passing chords here and there and I'm familiar with raising the bass note a whole step up for a jazzy slash chord at the very end of a phrase... But other than a few things like that, my jazz vocabulary is pretty limited and I can't seem to figure out how you do all these complex key modulations. There has to be a better way than aimlessly watching a bunch of jazz music theory videos on YouTube, right? Should I grind out the inversions? Should I learn how to write in minor keys? If you have a textbook I could read or anything to point me in tne right direction, I'd really appreciate your help!</qco> </h3><br><br>"
