Play this thing now or not at all\" so I'm trying excercises where I just flip to a random piece in \"the real book\" and play it as accurately and fast as possible. I find myself panicking and stressing myself out doing this though. So how to not panic? Or is panic is necessary to do better?\n    -Mr. Freak</qco> </h3>"
