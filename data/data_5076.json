I feel like I better understand myself from agreeing or disagreeing with you and then trying to understand exactly why I do, and what that entails. I have a question!\n\nYou seem to very adamantly hold the perspective that art either can only be made or is best made out of seeking relief from an uncomfortable intensity of personal emotion, such as frustration, sadness, or joy. </font> </h3><h3> <font color=\"#B387FF\"> \nThe intensity drives one to make art, sends one past a \"breaking point.\" In this way, art is a very personal and perhaps not at all altruistic practice. That said, art can have a profound impact on the life of others. I, for example, can claim to have an enriched life because of your work, from your videos to this question page. Should a desire to please or benefit others ever enter the equation in an artistic venture, in your opinion? </font> </h3><h3> <font color=\"#B387FF\"> \n What if a desire to please others IS that aforementioned strong emotion?</font> </h3><h3> <font color=\"#B387FF\"> \n</font> </h3><br><br>"

You have to be bred for that.\n\n\nRight.\n\n\nLook. That's more pollen\nthan you and I will see in a lifetime.\n\n\nIt's just a status symbol.\nBees make too much of it.\n\n\nPerhaps.

I never really thought about it in those terms, as far as which thing terrifies me less.  Thinking back, I would definitely say that doing shorter things is much less terrifying, and also I can actually DO it in the first place.  Longer things sap energy directly out of my soul when I try to do them, and that makes me wonder if I'm doing it wrong.\n\nThe problem I'm currently having is that while I can make as many short things as I want, they all contain extremely personal info and I do not feel comfortable showing them to most people.  I've tried to transition to something that doesn't feel as awkward to share, but I'm afraid that along the way it will all fall apart and I will be buried by the resultant avalanche of crippling self-doubt.
