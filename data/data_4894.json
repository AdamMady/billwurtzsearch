I thought microtonality just meant dividing the traditional 12-tone chromatic scale into more than 12 tones.. Can't you divide an octave into 13 evenly spaced intervals, or into 999999999 ka-zillion equally spaced intervals and have that be considered microtonal? I've never heard of microtonality as strictly referring to dividing the the 12 semitones in half... Just curious. </qco> </h3><br><br>"

Listen though, I think you should start making more videos. I think your videos are a masterpiece. And I have been thinking... if you want to make new songs, you can use songs like, notbugs, and hide the money. You can even make more monday videos, including music videos like murder your demon and even blue boy, because I really want to see that. And I hope you do more of those reality stuff you posted, like the reality video where you said you posted the japan video. I am still waiting to see what is next for your future. Thank you, and have a FANTASTIC day!</qco> </h3><br><br>"
