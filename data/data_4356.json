They are too small to get a picture with my phone. I work at an aquaculture place and we breed these little aquatic insects that are used in a lot of water-quality testing places. Basically we put an adult in a medicine cup and each week count the number of babies the adult produces. So, somehow, I'm supposed to count like usually between 40-50 of these borderline - microscopic baby bugs that are all swimming around in a tiny container. Im supposed to get an EXACT count and it's damn near impossible. Help?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
