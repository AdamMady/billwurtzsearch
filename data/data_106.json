Come to think of it, I don't think I've ever seen Clark Kent and Superman in the same place at the same time... suspicious...\n<br>\n<br>But, I guess he can't be Superman.

You can't really have art if you don't have life, but I would argue you can't have life without art. A life without art is barely life at all. So which imitated which first? Did they each imitate each other in tandem? Maybe life and art are even one in the same. Maybe everything is art. Maybe everything is life. Maybe... everything is... stuff. Woah.</qco> </h3>"
