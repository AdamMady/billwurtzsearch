I hope my follow up made more sense and had less mistakes at essential points. . So the 2 chord thing i was describing once i take your advice into consideration would be something like Ab bass (the F at the bottom was really unnecesary, its really some sort of Ab) with right hand doing g-bb-eb, and then going to G bass with f-g-bb-d on right hand. \n</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ah, much more comfortable<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you chose what to leave out when using many tensions on chords?\n</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experience, knowing the songs, knowing what sounds happen when you use different combinations of notes. the only way to really learn is to spend a lot of time with the instrument, a lot of time with songs, and general life experience. you will even find yourself gaining experience in stores, when you hear something on the radio<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or it's a feel-along excercise with the theory behind the played voicings being an afterthought to analyze what was done? Upon\n  yet ano\n ther revision my last version would be Ab (207.65) and on right hand g(392)-bb-c=eb which would translate to Abmaj7add9, and then for second chord Bb on bass (233) and then on right hand f(349)-bb-c-d. which would be a Bbadd9. Does it sound like a more balanced voicing?\n</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that seems great but very much on the high side. your bass notes are around middle C. this is cool, but if you are generally in the meat of the arrangement, your bass notes are going to be an octave lower (probably 2) and the right hand parts would be maybe half an octave lower. i'd say a nice happy range for your first chord (speaking in Hz again, cuz it's the only way to truly say which octaves we're using) Ab 52, and chord would start from Bb233 and up. a good range for the other one would be Bb 58, and C D F starting from middle C and up.<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did have a weird keys patch where i was jamming with it but going to a normal keyboard sound makes it clearer to hear what im doing instead of letting the reverb disguise the sound.
