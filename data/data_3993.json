I mean I make out everything anyone does or says or anything I do or say or anything anyone makes to be something powerful enough and big enough to change the world-but people tell me that's not how it works, that I can't change the world, and nothing else really can either. Well if that's true, what's even the point anyway? And if it's not true, and every action you take has the potential to change your life as well as billions of others, how do you take the right actions? Thabks.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
