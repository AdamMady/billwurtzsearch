But as I'm writing it, I'm finding that the more carefully written parts feel so forced and fake in comparison to the parts that were the initial inspiration for the song. I feel like I have this awesome idea, but the rest of the song just doesn't do it justice. Do you have any tips for my situation?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
