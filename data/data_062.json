As a first-time customer, I must say that I was all in all quite pleased with this product. However, I was disappointed to discover that the speed control (at least on the model I purchased) tended to be shaky and erratic. Moreover, there proved to be no readily accessible method by which to recall past moments or reclaim Time which was inadvertently spilled. I think I speak for myself and all future prospective purchasers of this product when I suggest that these bugs be patched in future models for a more friendly user experience. Thank you</qco> </h3>"
