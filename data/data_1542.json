I'm having severe issues with the VAST amounts of \n<br>misinformation being spread mainly by vox populi and youtube/internet articles regarding music education.\n<br>It's driving me nuts. One of the worst (and I tend to disagree on a lot of things), I think, it's about \n<br>the myth regarding strength and exercise needed to play an instrument, as if playing guitar, \n<br>piano or even drums required some sort of strong physical competence to the extent professional \n<br>athletes do. I truly believe that playing and instruments in general (save some occasions and styles like\n<br>flamenco or extreme metal, perhaps) are learned through very simple principles applied through musical \n<br>concepts (or just music), with just standard physical well being (in the majority of cases already \n<br>achieved) regardless of gender, ethnicity and to some extent age (and there tons of exceptions to my \n<br>favor to th\n is too!!\n  But let's play). I'm seeing people getting hurt trying to get better at their \n<br>instruments the wrong way and it breaks my heart. I'm a professional musician and educator and I would \n<br>really like to have your take on this. I think you are a true great musician and am a big fan of your work, \n<br>by the way! Cheers! P.S.: Just in case, nothing against sports, exercise, fitness or whatever.</qco> </h3><br><br>"

    "html": "<h3> <dco>8.16.19&nbsp; \n3:49 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Hello Bill. which method do you think is the best way to organize your music? I have lots of music on my archive that i've collected over the course of 20 years and that i deeply care about (i hate all sorts of streaming sites). And i've put a lot of effort into shaping my music directory and now i am looking at it thinking if i can use more simplified method.\n<br>\n<br>My music directory goes like this:\n<br>I have a main music directory named 'Music'. And then, this directory divides into the music genres, and then into subgenres, then into artists, then into albums (if there's any). Then you find mp3/flac files in those directories. If a song of said artist doesn't belong to any album (ie. single song, etc) it goes into directory named 'singles' in the artist's directory. Also, any songs whose artists i have only one song of, they go to the another directory named 'Singles' in the proper genre/subgenre.\n<br>\n<br>For example, if i wanna listen t\n o Michae\n l Jackson's Billie Jean, the path i have to go thru is Music -&gt; Pop -&gt; Michael Jackson - &gt; Thriller, because i have the entire album. \n<br>\n<br>Or, 'Zhi-Vago - Celebrate the Love (Club Mix)' is in Music -&gt; Electronic Music -&gt; Trance -&gt; Dream Trance -&gt; Singles, because it's the only song i have of Zhi-Vago.\n<br>\n<br>When you look at it, it really is good method. All songs from all artists in the same genre is in one place. It makes it easier to listen in Winamp. UNLESS artist have many songs from many different music genres. That's the frustrating part.\n<br>\n<br>Do you think this method is good?</qco></h3>"
