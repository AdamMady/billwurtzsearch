However as someone who just wants to know whats going on inside that brilliant brain of yours, it drives me absolutely insane! You so very clearly have ideas you want to \n convey a\n nd messages you want to communicate with everyone, and about 80% of these questions have genuine answers about motivation, attitude and inspiration, all of which are actually GREAT advice! If possible could you give an explanation of a lot of the motivation behind your songs?</qco></h3>      i've discovered that songs can unlock some of the deepest powers of the universe<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or at least in some way tell us a message or central idea you want your audience to take away from your music.</qco></h3>      the world has infinite power and it's on your side<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And don't worry, i'm not expecting a direct answer, both because you're not a very direct person in your responses most of the time, and more so because all great teachers of philosophy and introspective thought never just tell people what they are trying to get them to understand.</qco></h3>      ah, that's true. i think showing can be more effective than telling. even better than showing is if you can get them to actually do it ... or, for a twist, realize they already have done it <h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really really want a full response so I can understand your thought process. To be more clear, i'm not asking for a \"moral of the story\" message or anything like that, I'm asking more if there is a method of thought that you live by that leaks through in your songs? Because you have a very unique way of making song\n s that a\n lways seems to have deep and intertwining themes. If possible can you walk us through your philosophical approach to the world around you and your attitude towards trials in life as well as your way of expressing this through your music? \n</qco></h3>      that could take a lifetime but i am doing it anyway<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't worry, i'm already expecting on getting goofed on with a one word response, or getting a really backwards answer.
