Sometimes I need to anticipate the sound by 1 (or 2) frames with the image, but sometimes it feels off. Sometimes I try to do it by just hitting spacebar when it is the right moment to put the image, but i'm not quite sure of this method. What is your experience regardning this aspect of editing? Are there some software that make it more intuitive, for that particular issue?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
