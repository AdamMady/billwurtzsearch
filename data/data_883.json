This worries me because the way I try to orient myself on the piano and guitar is by completely relying on memorization of the major scale. For the key of the song and/or the chord of the current measure, I visualize the shape given by the major scale that corresponds with that chord as numbers from 1-7 (along with 9,11,13 I guess, and also stuff like #5, b3, etc.), and so those numbers go on different keys/frets depending on the key/current chord. I wouldn't really be sure how I'd find my way around without this orientation. Is this a bad way to be going about it, </qco></h3>      it would be bad for me, but, one of the wilder things i've learned in life is that different people are so different<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if so, is there another method you would suggest that doesn't rely on the major scale?</qco> </h3>      basically you could just start with one note. just play that note, now you know how it feels to play that note. so you have 2 options: playing the note, or playing nothing. think of the wonderous portraits you could paint, just from painting and not painting that note. Gradually, when you're ready, add another note to the notes you know. just learn what the notes sound like, 1 note at a time, and let them gradually assimilate themselves into your repetoire. the darn thing happens pretty much automatically the more time you spend around the instrument\n\n\n<br><br>"
