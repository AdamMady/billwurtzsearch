I'm woefully bad at lyrics, and a lot of the time I'm not even compelled to write them, because I stubbornly believe maybe the music I create will convey the emotions I'm trying to express on its own. Do you make your music with an emotion/other goal in mind and then write lyrics to m\n atch it,\n  or do you write your lyrics and then write music to match? If you do both, have you found that your final products tend to be different depending on your method, and in what way(s)?\n</qco></h3>      for best results, i have to come up with the words and music at the same time. they rely on each other so much, i'm almost asking for trouble if i try to do it separately<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks in advance so much for answering!</qco> </h3>      \n\n\n<br><br>"
