Playing the different modes while keeping the root the same is actually a big help in hearing the different qualities of each one. Thanks! But, wouldn't thinking in terms of modes mostly come in handy when you have a song where the harmony is just kind of vamping on 1 chord for a long time (or maybe multiple chords, but that change slowly.. as in, one chord every few bars or whatever)? \n\n\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nI guess it's really important to establish what the root is. Like C lydian is technically G major, so if you want it sound lydian and not like G major, you really gotta focus in on C and F# in the melody and hammer it in that you're not in plain old G major.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess thinking in terms of modes is mostly useful when you're really going for that specific quality/sound the modes have? </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way I was taught it (way back when I was taking lessons still) was to use modes when 'soloing over chord changes'. Like, if you have (to chose a boring, textbook example) a I-vi-ii-V in C, that you think ionian over the I, aeloian over the vi, dorain over the ii and mixolydian over the V. But that was never helpful to me to think in those terms.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
