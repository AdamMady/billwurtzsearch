The full measure is a dotted eighth, then a sixteenth note tied to a quarter note, then that 5,5,6, triplet thing. So that 5,5,6 triplet should take up 2 beats. So, it's like dividing 2 beats into 3 equal parts (3:2 quarter note triplet), then taking those 3 equal parts and dividing them again into 5,5, and 6 respectively? </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece also has several septuplets and pentuplets and all that kind of stuff... In general, what are some good ways to figure out how to hear/play this kind of timing? I can conceptualize it, and I think I understand how it works. But the challenge is like, okay, so how do I actually play 7 equally spaced hits over the span of 2 beats, or whatever? </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can play 3:2 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 note triplets because I hear them used all the time, and can just play it without actually counting it out, i just know how it sounds.. Is\n it possi\n ble to be able to sight read these kind of weird tuplets/polyrhythms? Or is it something that you just have to hear each particular rhythm over and over again until it sinks in? </qco> </h3>"
