When you have one idea on the piano, how long do you usually run with that? I've been getting back into creating music recently after a several years hiatus and I'm finding I am running with an idea for between 10 and 30 minutes or so before I can really move on to another totally different one. If i try earlier than that it is too similar. This is just idea Gen stage not songwriting so it feels way too slow. Any advice?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
