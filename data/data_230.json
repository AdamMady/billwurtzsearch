It seems apparent that music came to you pretty naturally so maybe you haven't experienced this. I've been making music in a DAW for a really long time, but I had sensory issues that didn't allow me to learn to play a physical instrument. I'm finding that I've hit a kind of block in my development of skills and understanding, like I've gone as far as I can with only messing around in a piano roll or writing notation. I've largely gotten over my sensory issues now, but I'm still struggling to stay focused long enough to devote the time necessary to learning an instrument. Do you think it's important for my development as a musician to try and\n defeat my adhd and physically play/improvise/experiment on a real instrument? Does this inspire your brain to generate any advice or words of encouragement? Not that you have any obligation to provide it, I just think you're\n pretty wise.</qco> </h3>"
