I never really thought about it in those terms, as far as which thing terrifies me less.  Thinking back, I would definitely say that doing shorter things is much less terrifying, and also I can actually DO it in the first place.  Longer things sap energy directly out of my soul when I try to do them, and that makes me wonder if I'm doing it wrong.\n\nThe problem I'm currently having is that while I can make as many short things as I want, they all contain extremely personal info and I do not feel comfortable showing them to most people.  I've tried to transition to something that doesn't feel as awkward to share, but I'm afraid that along the way it will all fall apart and I will be buried by the resultant avalanche of crippling self-doubt.  My inability to get all this to \"click\" together is driving me insane.  How do I avoid going insane in this way?  (sorry for this super-long question btw)</font> </h3>"
