It's kinda tragic, but it's one of the reasons why I really like your site. I think some users are trying to force you into some kind of \"Genre\" of creator (whether it be your site or music or etc) so much that people seem to believe that you're trying to be irreverent, but all you do is just... *is*. Words kinda fail me there, and that's okay I think. People are looking at the pages that update \"top-down\" (as in \"updates as you finish content\" such as the music, videos, and most of the time the questions page) a\n nd autom\n atically assume that it applies to Literally Everything In The Entire World Ever All The Time Always when your notebook stuff is clearly labeled with a very definite Date Of Time, emphasizing Creation Chronology, but your site didn't exist forever so you come to this design dilemma for the content that was made Pre-Website: Emphasize Creation Chronology, or Update Chronology? Well, it's not really a dilemma, but it's more that people are too busy trying to see you in their terms as a creator so much that they're missing out on the actually new content. Something about not seeing the forest for the trees?</qco> </h3><br><br>"

Some pretty cool stuff. In You Really Got Me, Ray Davies apparently used a razor blade to splice the speaker cone in his amp and poked pins into the cone. In Street Fighting Man, Keith Richards got an electric-guitar sound from an acoustic by using a tape cassette to record and overdub the parts and by playing right up to the mic. Link Wray used to poke holes in his speaker cone with pencils to get that fuzzy tone. You had all sorts of experimentation with reel to reel tape recorders to get echos and other weird effects. Lots of old blues guitarists would turn the gain and volume all the way up on lo-fi amps to the point of nearly blowing out the speakers to get their sounds. Sam Phillips (who produced a lot of those 50's rockabilly/rock 'n' roll records with Sun Records) would re-feed the playback from the recorder to the head, adjusti\n ng the s\n pace between the heads, tape speed and other stuff to make crazy echo and delay effects.... Today with all sorts of effects pedals, built in effects on amplifiers, digital recording sofwares where you can alter the sounds in so many different ways, do you think that these \"proto-effects\" or these old recording techniques are obsolete? </qco></h3>"
