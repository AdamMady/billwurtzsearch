The power of sleeping and Triangles. Then he flew into the sky, and ate the aliens ship. After that, some song called \"long long long journey\" played. It was really cool, and even had triangle boy in it! And then, he finally got to trade his dust for grass, and turn it into more grass. What did you think of the movie?</qco> </h3>"
