So instead of memorizing 2 8note chords,</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i memorized 4 4 note chords,</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it always made sense since it felt like memorizing smaller chunks would make it easier. The thing is, when moving from first set of 8 to second set of 8, the checklist becomes twice as long when trying to make the change fast, since I have to run the checklist of 2 4 note chords as opposed to a big one. So my mind is split making sure I got the left hand right and then the right hand right (and with the memorized finger positions).</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let's say I have a less than ideal memorized way of placing my fingers on the notes because that's how i first came upon them, then I would just be repeating my mistake everytime simply because thats how i memorized the 2 blocks. But on the other hand if my \"mental check list\" goes note by note from the bottom up, then my hands might fix the mistake the second time i play by going \"ah, that makes more sense how my fingers landed on the notes this time around\" and instead of memorizing how to place my hand on them, my hands start learning finger placement instinct in a sense, and i have more mental space to do/think other things. I always thought it was easier to memorize both blocks because, lets say for the second 8 note chord I could memorize Gb7</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on left hand and a Bbadd9 on the right hand, both on root position. But I am coming to the realization that seeing them this way may intelectualize the process too much and make me think&nbsp;&nbsp;of music in more math/pattern terms rather than feeling the music. As for the puzzle part, if i just play the right notes and not worry about which hand does which, the hands slowly start gaining instinct of how to play what. And everytime you play them, you're figuring out the finger-placement puzzle again, or atleast starting to make the connection of both hands working as one as opposed to LH does x, RH does&nbsp;&nbsp;y. Another advantage I believe is that when changes need to be made to the voicing they are made to the whole at the same time, and rebalancing voices in the other hand to fit the change becomes easier. Because you don't need to relearn both blocks again and/or how they differ from the previous version of the chord, you just need to solve a new puzzle when playing.Mentally it feels kind of like the first time I started seeing the harmonies in classical music as opposed to just learning the notes and the order they come in at. Way easier to play bach's prelude 1 if you know the chords that are being arpeggiated rather than learning/reading each note by itself as it comes. I thin I am slowly unhindering myself of the limitations of the way I learned to play music as a kid. It just always seemed so intimidating to me seeing people improv 2 handed chords</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over changes and I thin perhaps they weren't thining of them as 2 separate blocks one for each hand, but as one whole thing. The other advantage to not seeing it as 2 hands I believe is that it's easy to say, well that chord needs one less note, and just play the chord and let the fingers figure out who plays who, as opposed to trying to keep balance or saying \"well, there was 4 and 4, now theres 4 and 3, i should probably take one out of the left hand too to make it balanced\" when the balance perhaps doesn't lie in number of notes in each hand but simply what the music needs, which might not always makes sense in the pattern/balance-seeking frame of mind. I hope it makes more sense or atleast shows what I'm thinking better.\n<br>\n<br>Tl;dr, \"Gb7 on left hand, Bbadd9 on right hand\" turns into G-Bb-D-F-Bb-C-D-F.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First one might make more sense for writing down/analyzing, second might be more instinctive and wont rely on having to make sense of each hand as an individual chord. Like, on the example of the first chord F-Ab-C-Eb-G-Bb-Eb-G, itd be hard to categorize G-Bb-Eb-G as a recognizable chord, perhaps some sort of Eb in first inversion with a doubled 3rd on the top but I want to let my ears do the listening, my fingers the playing and my mind the enjoying instead of intelectualizing it. It may seem I'm saying the newer way im doing it is better but I think maybe it just complements something that's been lacking in my approach to music thus far and a balance must be found as opposed to committing to one way or the other. I find the mind of a piano harmony improvizer intriguing and I hope this new approach makes it less convoluted in my head. It just seems like itll be way easier to improvize when im not trying to first make two independent hand voicings and placing them together as opposed to thining of a big voicing spread through all my fingers (and let them do the chosing of which plays what note as opposed to summoning up some finger positions from the catalogue since my catalogue may be too limited atm. It feels like when playing with this new frame of mind, it's easier to try new stuff and let the music speak to me. How do you approach memorizing/improvizing voicings when you are writing/arranging/playing?&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
