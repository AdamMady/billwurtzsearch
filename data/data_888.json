This actually won't take care of the entire song, because if you only do sprinkles, you will usually never end up getting the important mainstays like the kick and bass, etc, but, it is a good technique nonetheless. it is particularly exciting when you do sprinkles first, before doing anything else. by the way this only works if you've written the song first before you start recording it, and have the exact road map\n\n<br><br>"
