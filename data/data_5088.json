I hope it brings you as much joy to make it as it does for me to listen to it (which is a lot)! As a creative, would you recommend pursing a career in a creative job (screenwriting) even though statistically I will likely not find serious work? I have stories I'm very proud of and I want to tell but sometimes I worry it's just a pipe dream, and I ought to wisen up. (Unfortunately I'm not related to anyone currently in the film industry). Thank you.&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
