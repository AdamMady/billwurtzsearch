I remember a while back you wrote that one of the ways that worked for your creative process involved consuming so much media or watching so many Other People's works that eventually you would EXPLODE with the desire to create when you couldn't take anymore! (I'm paraphrasing so if I got something wrong I'm sorry) I'm a little bit worried because along the way that I've been kinda following that idea, I've started unfortunately looking at things I once liked with a gross negativity that I can't shake off. I know that everyone is different and no advice works perfectly for everyone (it is as unique as the person) but I wanted to know if this was... \"normal\"? or that it might be an expected step? I hope that makes sense;&nbsp;it's been really weird and I'm a little scared that I might fall into a dark pessimism before bursting with creativity. If that's too weird or difficult to answer, I\n  guess I\n  want to ask if you've been through something similar and how you managed to BREAK OUT! and get the motivation to do something CRAZY to get out of that ugly negative rut. thank you</qco> </h3>"
