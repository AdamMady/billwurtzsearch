I've suddenly started getting constant brain fog/issues with thinking around a year ago which is SUPER scary considering I'm only 18 and it feels like no one takes me seriously even though it quite literally ruined my life and made me spiral into the worst depression ever. I have always been bad at figuring out what to do so I'm wondering what you would recommend I do. I would kill to go back to when I didn't have this crippling brain fog. I'm sure I'll be fine + I know you are probably the wrong person to be asking about stuff like this but I mean I don't know who else to go to I don't have many friends. anyways keep up what you're doing me and many others really appreciate it. &lt;3</qco> </h3><br><br>"
