(microwaves, car horns, your electronic devices, etc. just get to know them all. you probably won't forget). based on your early childhood experience, you may find that you have at least one note absolutized in your memory. and you can learn to work with that quite easily, although 12 times slower than someone who had all 12 absolutized from childhood. i've actually never met anyone who has that, and i've never heard of anyone having that while also being really good and comfortable with everything musical / relativity has to offer. i trust that it's possible but haven't seen it yet. which is somewhat re-assuring to those of us who forgot to learn in any key other than C until age ........ 7<br><br>"
