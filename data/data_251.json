However, the RECORDINGS often include many random-seeming notes which make the chords much more complex, making it harder to make what I feel is a \"definitive\" version, a.k.a. a sort of \"prototype\" of the song, or how you would write it in your own mind before adding all those decorative instrumentals. My question is, do you usually come up with all those crazy chords right away, or do you start simpler (limiting yourself to maybe m9 or 7sus4 at the maximum complexity, for example)?</qco> </h3>"
