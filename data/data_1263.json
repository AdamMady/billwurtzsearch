I've been playing the piano casually since I was small and now that I'm trying to get into some more \"adult\" pieces I find that my hands seem to be too small. I can barely stretch an octave without twisting my wrists. Do you have any suggestions on how I can play the pieces I want to play without having to cut out parts of chords? Ps I'm at the age that I know my hands aren't going to get significantly bigger so just waiting for them to grow wouldn't really be a viable solution\n<br></qco> </h3><br><br>"
