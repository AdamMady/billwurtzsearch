Although I'm fairly confident with the chords, it can never sing/play it properly, something about the fill into that part confuses me. I'm certain it stays in 4/4, but when I count 4/4 over it, it almost feels like it goes out and then fades back in time? Is there anything that you did rhythmically in that part which could throw me off there? </qco></h3>"
