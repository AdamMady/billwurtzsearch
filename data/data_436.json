We think it's a low F# but it's hard to tell.\n<br>Also, i know this is a lot of work, but it would be nice to just have the sheet music to the parts in your songs so that it's easy to know what the chords are when there are like 8 notes playing at the same time, so that we can play your songs PERFECTLY with peace of mind we didn't get one of the notes wrong somewhere, because that is the kind of thing that will keep you awake at night.</qco> </h3>"
