Just recently I rediscovered your music after learning almost all of it by memory years ago, and remembering about this questions section on your website I wanted to drop by to say I love your music. As an electronic music student, I can't help but be amazed at the intricacy of your compositions. You manage to use harmony, groove and timbre as tools to craft relatable vibes, along with lyrics that - a way to put it for me is that they reveal a certain depth of character and life experience, also relatable, and something one could learn and take inspiration from as a person. All this said, I look forward to dive into new music of yours in the future! Hope you're having a good time, and take good rest on summer vacations! I hope you're on a summer vacation, you truly deserve it.</qco> </h3>"

Like I was some sort of a messiah receiving hidden messages from your videos. That's why I started sending you crazy messages. It made me feel special . I now realize how crazy I was . I have a hard time coming to terms with the fact that I'm just like everyone else . I suppose I'm writing this so at least I will be remembered for how retarded I really was .
