I have been on a bonkers schedule for a little under a year, and in that time I have conquered a considerable chunk of the observable universe thanks to the schedule. It really drags you along and makes you get things done. But I'm thinking of going off the schedule, partially because I just rediscovered the unobservable universe and really wanna go crazy and do something different in there. \n<br>\n<br>On one hand, this is exciting beyond the belief. Dropping the schedule feels like freedom. (I'm also pretty tired from making content daily, so I love the idea of a change of pace.) On the other hand, I haven't been off-schedule in a long time, and the schedule itself gave me the initial jolt of energy I needed to get going, so I fear the lack of direction/motivation that (sometimes) comes from having no schedule. \n<br>\n<br>You've done all sorts of schedules and non-schedules... any advice?</qco> </h3>"
