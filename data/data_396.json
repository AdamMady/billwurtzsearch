    "html": "<h3> <dco>6.16.23&nbsp; \n11:14 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco>   I've been thinking about how much something's/someone's reputation affects people's perception...\n\nLike, are the songs in the \"Real Book\" great, timeless pieces of music and therefore were chosen to be in the book for that reason, or have the songs become standards BECAUSE they were put into the Real Book? </qco></h3>      there are different types of songs in there. a large percentage of them were already standards for a long time before they were in the book. These are things like 1930s songs with lyrics, many of which were featured in theatrical musicals, and were very popular. There's also a totally different, fairly small category of music in that book, which are songs that were trendy amongst the players who compiled the book at that time. many of those ones are probably not-so-classic, and certainly are not standards. but, regardless, there are plenty of tunes in the book that just, for one reason or another, just usually aren't good, or they aren't good when played from the book. so these are the ones people don't like to play. they turn to the page and say \"hmm, let's try this one\" and then it's like \"eich, no that one sucks\" and they don't do it. but then there are some that just shine like the sun, even through the paper. so naturally those ones are the good ones. And very often, the ones that were big hits long before the book, are damn great in the book also, even without the lyrics. what tends to make something a 'standard' is if it endures popularity for many many years. Generally if you look at the songs played at weddings, or in the pubs, you will get a more updated idea of what today's \"standards\" are  <h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Real Book was never published, would a whole new set of songs have become \"the standards\"?</qco></h3>      over all, in my opinion, the Real Book has had very little influence on what songs have endured popularity among listeners and players<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or what if Shakespeare never published any work when he was alive, and nobody ever heard of him until someone in the 21st century just happened to digup some chest in some old crypt that had all of Shakespeare's writings... would 21st century critics still be like \"OK, this guy is the greatest playwright and greatest English writer of all time... we must make high school and college students study his work\"? </qco></h3>      it would struggle against a 400-year language barrier. even though he was spicy fresh with the language, there is no longer a population of native speakers of the language base he was starting from. if he were born in the modern day, he'd surely do it damn great, starting from our language as we know it today and then pushing it forward from there <h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or if Jimi Hendrix wasn't on every magazine/internet list as the \"Greatest Guitarist of All Time\", would as manyguitarists still think of him as being so great? </qco></h3>      if someone \"assumes he is probably great\", i don't count that. the exposure helps, but in a way it's a curse because some people probably feel pressured to like him so they never can give him a good genuine first-hand listen<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember my dad playing me Hendrix when I was a kid and saying something like \"Hey, listen closely, this guy's the best.\" </qco></h3>      yeah, that's a real buzz-kill for music. music recommendation is extremely sensitive, and it can backfire easily<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nAll our lives, I feel that we are explicitly told by schools, articles, magazines, parents, etc. \"This artist is great because blah blah blah... that artist is a genius because blah blah blah...\" </qco></h3>      yeah whatever, that's clickbait, don't worry about that. in time you'll figure out what really floats your actual boat<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nYou know those little memory-eraser things fromthe Men In Black movies? I wonder if the whole world had their memory erased, but all the music, art, literature, etc. still remained... would peoplestill gravitate towards what is today considered \"great\"? </qco></h3>      no one's true feelings about anything would change. fake feelings however, would be what gets the re-set<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nSorry, I don't know what my question is exactly\n... just ramblin on over here. </qco>\n\n     \n\n\n<br><br></h3>"
