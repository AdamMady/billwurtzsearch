Now i'm 18 and i gotta decide what my next move will be. I would really love music as a career but i'm on the fence, i have some doubts. I want to either make music as my career or computer science. My family and friends mostly support the computer science, because pay is better and there are more job opportunities but even though computer science is enjoyable, music is like enjoyable x100. Do i have to go to music school? I mean i have a lots of gaps in my knowledge and i need to fill that. Or i might somehow make two of the choices work at the same time. Did you go to music school? How's the pay for a musician new in the scene? I love playing to a crowd and seeing them enjoy my performance that's one of the many ways of music i love</qco> </h3>"

I agree with the point that I think paul was making, that popular music isn't for whatever reason less valid or has less artist merit than the \"high class stuff\"... but was classical music actually popular in its time? Like didn't mozart and beethoven and all those guys mostly perform for royalty and stuff? And you had to be really rich to go see an orchestra or an opera or whatever, and there wasn't any recorded music or radio or anything.... Wouldn't popular music at that time have been the music people made themselves, like traditional folk songs and church hymns and stuff??</qco> </h3>"
