What do you think is the advantage of improvising/noodling a solo as opposed to just writing/working out a melody line to play over the solo section? \n</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like most musicians can probably write a melody/lead line (whatever you want to call it) that is better than something they can improvise on the spot. I think improv can definitely be a powerful writing tool, but why not improv over x amount of bars until you work out some cool parts, cut out the noodling, and just choose the best parts.. rinse and repeat until you have a cohesive 'solo' that is fully worked out and arranged?\n</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, even for the most talented musicians, if they're improvising an extended solo there's probably gonna be at least some moments in there that just sound kind of aimless/meandering/not very strong.&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"

In one of ur recent songs u said u have a plane just in case you need to swiftly get away and in your the day goes on song you said you come down to Virginia to change ur name just incase you have to fly away. Later on in the song u said u built a time machine to go to the future but go off topic so I think you saw the future in ruins because you didn't upload because a man went insane because you didn't upload so he launched nukes to blow the world up and u found that out so to save the world you needed to go back to the present And make a video. you were currently leaving a school of some sort in the I think I might quit so you left and went down to Virginia and there you flew away in your airplane. You then went to Japan to write the history of Japan down. (Going backwards in your videos.) So you then went to middle east Asia (Egypt). To write the history of the wor\n ld because society started in Egypt. As said in your history of the entire world you guess. You learned new found wisdom from your old family's house front door where your ancestors were born so then you went to your recording studio and made a video because it all took the span of two years and uploaded the day before the insane person nuked the world. Is this true?</qco> </h3>"
