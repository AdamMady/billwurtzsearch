You do this with common structures for questions, as well. I have a great respect for it, because it feels like you're stopping generalization and forcing people to look even harder at things. However, I am in a cognitive science class, and it is teaching me that analogy is fairly specific to humans, and it might be what has allowed us to advance beyond other species. We can apply learned information in a highly abstract way to many facets of our lives when we recognize similar structure, whereas other animals cannot. So now I am torn!
