I dont know if that makes more or less sense. And i did call Gb7 something wrong. I think its the Gmin7 with a \"Bb add9\" on top. so really a Gmin7 add11 with doubled 5th and 7th,&nbsp;&nbsp;but revisitting it it should be a Bb something, as so the F something should really be a Ab something. and yes i do agree these are separate universes, but i wont let that excuse me from doing things in a perceivably wrong way(regardless of how thick i want my supersaws to sound). I get too sidetracked for beefiness that I may be overdoing the voicings and cluttering the arrangement (and missing the tonal center). Highly truly appreciate you taking your time to go over my rant and bring obje\n ctivity.\n &nbsp;&nbsp;Now I have another point of view(and way more experienced) on my voicing approach or atleast cataloguing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it feels like im working on a vacuum but im super grateful and lucky to be able to bounce these things with a way more experienced skillster to atleast have a sense of where the needle might be pointing as opposed to letting my subjectivenes or missfocus from sidetracking me into a least-ideal place. I hope my follow up made more sense and had less mistakes at essential points. . So the 2 chord thing i was describing once i take your advice into consideration would be something like Ab bass (the F at the bottom was really unnecesary, its really some sort of Ab) with right hand doing g-bb-eb, and then going to G bass with f-g-bb-d on right hand. \n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you chose what to leave out when using many tensions on chords?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or it's a feel-along excercise with the theory behind the played voicings being an afterthought to analyze what was done? Upon\n  yet ano\n ther revision my last version would be Ab (207.65) and on right hand g(392)-bb-c=eb which would translate to Abmaj7add9, and then for second chord Bb on bass (233) and then on right hand f(349)-bb-c-d. which would be a Bbadd9. Does it sound like a more balanced voicing?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did have a weird keys patch where i was jamming with it but going to a normal keyboard sound makes it clearer to hear what im doing instead of letting the reverb disguise the sound. It seems like by your description your instinct would be to go for bass on left and guide tones (3rd and 7th) on right and then alter from there?&nbsp;\n</qco></h3>"

In one of your reality vids from 2011, you said that in the past you've thought that there was a way to get songs perfect, and you followed that up by saying that \"perfect is invisible\" and that it's \"perfectly empty, abscent, etc.\".
