Would you think this is something that's possible for someone not even acquainted with you? I heard that every lyric you write is deliberate and I would believe that immediately. Either way, whether you say it's possible or not I'm still likely gonna try. Expect a 10 hour analysis video about your videos someday in the future mr wurtz. I have immense respect and curiosity for you.</qco> </h3>"
