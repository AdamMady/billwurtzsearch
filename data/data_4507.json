I know you say that the 'best' chord is the one that best supports the melody, but any melody can be harmonized in like a billion different ways, each giving its own unique character to the melody. When you're writing a song do you consciously think about dissonance&nbsp;&amp; consonance or tension&nbsp;&amp; release? </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, I kind of base it off the lyrics and/or how the melody makes me feel.
