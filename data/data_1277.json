But right now I'm working on a song that requires lyrics. As it turns out, lyrics are fuckin' DIFFICULT. The music I usually write isn't very self-expressive;&nbsp;I'm more interested in seeing what I can bring to life in the mind of the listener by using different sounds, tones, and techniques. Writing lyrics feels more akin to public speaking. A very personal, intimate form of public speaking. </qco></h3>      that's true<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not used to communicating my thoughts so directly. I don't want to divulge too much of myself, but also I don't want my lyrics to be inane or cliche. Maybe I'm being too self conscious, or too aware of the hypothetical audience. In fact, I'm pretty sure that's it. Why is it that I always end up answering my own questions every time I go to ask them? Oh well, I'm still going to submit this one because I want to hear your thoughts.</qco> </h3>      the funny thing is that you can use absolutely anything. there is so much room to do things that no one has ever done before. just to focus on the word side of things, for you what i would recommend is, open up a text file. and go bonkers every day for 3 meals on a regular basis. that's just to get in the mood. when it comes time to actually do musical lyrics, i recommend coming up with it musically. and if you have been going bonkers in the text lately, i think you will be on your best game, linguistically and otherwise\n<br><br>"
