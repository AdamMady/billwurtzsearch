I've listened to the Beatles, Queen, Elton John, etc, the legends, y'know? And while their stuff is good, it's not \"incredible\", like my first artist. Do I have expectations that are too high to compete with, or am I just lucky to have one artist I love so much, and give up on that ever happening again?
