I know you don't usually pick favorites besides not picking a favorite, and that makes loads of sense for sandwiches. Sandwiches are an experience. Eating them one way is a waste of your time. Anyways, back to the question. Do you have a favorite sandwich, or a sandwich you usually like to prepare? Not that I'm implying that the favorite sandwich is the one you usually like to prepare or vice versa, I'm just saying one you gravitate towards, not necessarily in a favorite sort of way, if you don't have a favorite or favorites.</qco> </h3>"
