I had that in mind and I think you could probably find inspiration to make a video (maybe about the game, maybe about something completely different), you probably dont lack inspiration and maybe the game doesnt give it to you at all...

Like, if you post a song in the key of D or whatever, you'd probably not want the next song you post to be in the same key,right?&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that's also something you should do when playing live (don't play two songs in the same key back to back)?&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
