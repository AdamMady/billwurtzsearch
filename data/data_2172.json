Working completely alone is a different thing. it means you can't use actors, you can't have camera operators, .... you are limited to entirely different mediums, like animation, etc. and that is very hard work. like i said, it depends on your level of difficulty in working with others. if you really really can't do it (like i can't) then it might be worth it to re-imagine your entire career around things you can do yourself. at least until you have more resources. nowadays you can get further than ever working alone\n<br><br>"
