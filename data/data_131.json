(or another very low number of samples) if that's actually the case, why'd you do it that way? are the performance savings from only doing 1 sample that great, or is there something else you're doing to the video? a lot of the lines (on the pixel level) just feel..... oddly jagged, like there's no anti-aliasing going on at all\n\n.......actually just looking at the pixels a little closer, and i'm gonna revise my question: am i crazy or is there an extremely extremely subtle amount of edge detection being done across almost every object in the video? i'm actually seeing some anti-aliasing on closer inspection (indicative of a normal number of samples for rendering), but tons of edges are outlined with a thin black line. (if true) i'm curious why you did that for \"here comes the sun\", and also why not any other videos, at least that i've noticed (and if not true, what the heck am i seeing?)\n\ni think i've established that i'm definitely crazy, though, so this whole thing is probably a moot point anyways       \n</qco> </h3>"

For instance, last night I went to a nice Belgian restaurant. It was rather elegant, with good-quality (if a bit overpriced) food, and a rather elderly clientele. However, they were playing EDM/rave music at full blast in there throughout the whole time we were there, and while it didn't seem to bother everyone else too much, it drove me nuts. I'm not a particular fan of that kind of music, but that's not what bothered me about it-what bothered me was that it didn't match the restaurant's atmosphere and ambiance at all. In fact, it seemed to be a continued disturbance to the atmosphere, and it stuck out like a sore thumb. It was too bad, because I liked the food, and the decoreverything else was enjoyable, except the music.\nDo things like this ever happen to you? Do you have any advice on how to deal with situations like this (assuming that it wouldn't really be feasible to change the music)?</qco> </h3>"
