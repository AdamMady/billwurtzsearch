'too small' was a little better but still not good enough. actually it's ok i guess. usually i don't find myself in a position to be slave to a rhyme but that's a rare case i guess. echoing it added confidence i suppose. I just thought of a better line, \"guess i'll go home and cry about it\" now you may think that's dumb and 'doesn't rhyme' or whatever, but you haven't heard how i would put it musically in context\n<br><br>"
