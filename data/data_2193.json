In sure it was tough to work on a project for almost a year, especially while getting so many questions about when the video will be done, why aren't you posting any videos, etc... ideally, would you have liked to make hotewig even longer and more detailed/inclusive? Or when you first stated working on the project did you kind of set a time limit for how long you wanted it to be (like you told yourself you wanted it to be around 20min or so)? Btw I love the video as is, and I don't mean to sound as if I'm criticizing it or anything like that. Just curious how the finished product compared to your early expectations in terms of detail and length.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
