When I plug a whole note into my software it doesn't let me add any other notes because I think the software thinks that I want to add the notes after 4 beats of the whole note and not while it's ringing out, but maybe I'm writing it wrong. How would you write that out (by hand)?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
