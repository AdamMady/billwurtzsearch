The lyrics especially have intrigued me and sometimes puzzled me throughout the years. \n\nI've noticed in the past when folks have asked you questions about the \"deeper meaning\" to the lyrics of your songs you coyly respond with answers that read something along the lines of \"deeper than what?\".</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll admit, I once asked you a question like this several years ago on this pageand indeed received a similar answer. At the time I felt quite miffed, butthen I soon saw that many folks were asking this kind of question, and I believe I was asking the wrong question.\n\nYou see, over theyears I kept thinking about this question I asked and your answer from time to time, and i think it started to make me ponder about the relationship that music artists can have with their songs, their fans; and the interpretation that their fans have of their music.\n\nI've seensome artists, when asked the question \"what's the meaning of song [X]?\", have a specific message in their mind they want song [X] to display, or perhaps a certain story they want the song to tell. In contrast, I have seen other artists not explain any specific \"deeper meaning\" to the songs that they make, and indeed these artists say that a song means whatever the listener feels they mean.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nFor example, your song \"And The Day Goes On\" (one of my favorites!): I like this song a lot, and to me, the \"meaning\" of the song is to persevere and press on when life gets stressful or tough. However, I understand that others may not interpret this song the same way that I do, and it really doesn't matter to me how others interpret the song - I like it for what it is for me.\n\nBut this does get somewhat to the crux of my question, and it's a hard question for me to articulate because I've never tried to write songs before. I'm not looking forcontext about certain songs, but I am curious in general about the relationship artists may have with their published work.\n\nWhen you write songs, do they ever have a certain \"meaning\" to YOU?</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you write songs hoping that your audience will interpret them in their own way and enjoy the song for what it is, regardless of what the song may (or may not) mean to you? Or is the process completely different? I'm curious about your thoughts on this idea.\n</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThank you and take care!   \n</qco> </h3>"
