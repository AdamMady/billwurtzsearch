But then I was like, no it wouldn't because then you wouldn't be making the unique and great stuff you are doing as much. The person who made that dramatic piano song has more of that stuff, and every musician ever has stuff of there own style, and that's the beauty of it. People don't need to force themself to do a certain style, because other musicians will be doing that style. People can cover what they want to and/or capable of. And just because I can't get my music into the style I look up to, doesn't mean I'm failing, as people have complemented my music before, and as long as I keep going I will get better at covering my style of music</qco> </h3><br><br>"
