(As it so happens, I learned traditional grip first because the first kind of drumming I ever learned was marching snare, but I rarely ever use it anymore, I prefer matched grip for almost all applications I've encountered as a rock drummer, but that's probably entirely because I play a lot of rim shots, and I find those very challenging to do with traditional grip.)</qco> </h3>"
