Since the last song was also available before the video, does that mean you picked \"before\"?</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n Follow-up question, do you know that the song video automatically generated by youtube is region locked such that we can only listen to your new song if it's passed midnight in our timezone? Would you be willing to release the song directly on your website at the same time as that song video is generated? That way we could all enjoy your new song at the same time regardless of local time, instead of having to do through silly lengths to bypass the region lock.</qco> </h3>"
