(I found it to be toxic and although I am quite good I grew to hate the tedious practicing) In the last month ive discovered a passion for creating music. It's always been there, but now is not blocked by stress for the need to practice classical. i hear all these jazz and funky music ideas in my head. but when i go to play them my muscle memory in my hands just reverts to a classical style. I feel like I know too much theory and practiced so much in this specific style i can't actually play whats in my head. can you please help or offer advice?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>      \n\ni've never been in your situation with that kind of background. but i think that muscle memory is getting in your way because it has no connection to the sound. so you're probably gonna need to completely start over. make it totally different. my first idea here is to start off just trying to play with 1 finger. maybe even just the back of your finger\n<br><br>"
