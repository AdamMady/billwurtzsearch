(which is interesting, because that's technically not the question that was asked;&nbsp;that's a reaffirmation of what the question presumed to be true already in its phrasing, that everything was stupid. but it also might be an answer to the question anyway, in the stupidest possible way: everything is stupid because it's stupid. that's a pretty stupid answer, which seems about right.) the 'rock in a plaid shirt' part seems to be a kind of last-ditch effort at something that isn't stupid, something new, but it all goes w\n rong, an\n d it sounds like (with the falling pitches and the final kick drum hit on 'stupid') that the end of blades of grass really was meant to be an admission of defeat. \n<br>\n<br>i just thought this was odd considering that you seem to be a fan of stupid;&nbsp;the two 'stupid songs' you've made seem to suggest you think stupidity can get you to stronger songs, videos, etc. but in blades of grass it seems like stupidity stands for a lack of meaning, and there's no way you're trying to say that nothing means anything - that's like the ultimate anti-bill wurtz sentiment as far as i can tell. let me know if any of this seems comprehensible to you. thanks</qco> </h3>"
