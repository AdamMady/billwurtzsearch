It's customary for me to build up quickly a sense of defeat confronting any slight obstacle. Take as an example, spending too much time on a question than expected, getting lost for a huge chunk of time on my way to destination and the like. I do understand it's common for everyone that do things to experience defeats and get a bit depressed on their way to victory, but some people just build up this mood very slowly or it can be easily eclipsed by something else, which marks a sharp difference with my own case-overwhelmed and giving up too quickly before I can strike the sweetpoint. I wonder there are any tricks behind this, for restoring the right state to continue&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
