The full measure is a dotted eighth, then a sixteenth note tied to a quarter note, then that 5,5,6, triplet thing. So that 5,5,6 triplet should take up 2 beats. So, it's like dividing 2 beats into 3 equal parts (3:2 quarter note triplet), then taking those 3 equal parts and dividing them again into 5,5, and 6 respectively? </qco></h3>"
