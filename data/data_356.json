Thank you.&nbsp;</qco> </h3>      \nif you have stories, you should go ahead and tell them. this does not necessarily mean doing something as formal as what you described in your statistical analysis. and, in fact, if you tell your own stories, statistically, that's gonna work. you're gonna be able to do it. the statistical unlikelihood you described earlier had more to do with job-searching in a collaborative industry, and much less to do with telling stories, especially your own\n<br><br>"
