A lot of factors contributed to this: the director, the group of ppl that formed the choir, the songs we chose, the standard we held ourselves toÂ… Since leaving school, i've tried joining other choirs, and while they haven't been *bad* experiences, i always just end up feeling disappointed that it's not as special as high school choir was. How do i get over that so i can enjoy choir again?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
