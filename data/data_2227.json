I had that in mind and I think you could probably find inspiration to make a video (maybe about the game, maybe about something completely different), you probably dont lack inspiration and maybe the game doesnt give it to you at all...

But, do you ever transpose the key of the song just to intentionally mix things up? Like, if you post a song in the key of D or whatever, you'd probably not want the next song you post to be in the same key,right?&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that's also something you should do when playing live (don't play two songs in the same key back to back)?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
