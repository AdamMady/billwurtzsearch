Also how are you?</qco> </h3>      what always works for me in those situations is to start expressing myself in any way possible, whether it's written text, improvised music, or spoken words, even just discussing and anlyzing the situation. that's just because stirring up mental energy is the main way that i function and feel alive. it also gives me a lot of extra comfort to also know that i am documenting those expressions as a souvenir of the struggle. for me, that always works. i often recommend the same thing to other people, but actually i just realized that maybe not everyone else is exactly the same as me\n\n<br><br>"
