With my last name being \"Caan\" I've had to deal with SO many people yelling \"Khaaaaaaaaaaan!\" (like from Star Trek), also, I've lost count of the times where I've had to tell people that no, I am not Shao Kahn from Mortal Kombat or Shere Khan from Jungle Book. I'm also not related to James Caan or Madeline Kahn. And in the past couple of years, I don't think I need to tell you how people react whenever I say \"My name is Jeff.\".... I would like to use your question page as an opportunity to give a PSA to all those who read these questions. DO NOT MAKE JOKES ABOUT SOMEBODY'S NAME. THEY HAVE HEARD THE JOKE BEFORE COUNTLESS TIMES. YOU ARE NOT ORIGINAL, AND THEY DO NOT THINK IT IS FUNNY. If somebody's name is Jesse don't say \"Ha! Tha\n t's a gi\n rls name!\" If somebody's name is Duncan, don't call them \"Duncan Donuts\". If somebody's name is Richard, yes, they know that Dick is short for Richard and that dick can mean penis. If somebody's shares the same last name as a celebrity or a character from a tv show/movie/book, don't ask them if they are related to that person/character. If somebody's first and last name rhyme or if they have \"two first names\", you don't have to point that out for them. They know.&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"

But, I have a good solid base of stuff to go off of. But right now, I'm stuck in a MAJOR rut. Like, what do I do with all this music? The logical thing I think would be pairing music with videos, graphics, or some kind of visual aspect. But the thing is, I've never really felt the \"calling\" of being a video-maker. It's not really something I'm passionate about at all, in the same way I am about making music... and if im not passionate about it, why even do it? Even if I do decide to at least try making videos, I have no experience in it and wouldn't even know where to begin... Also, I feel like just making videos for the sake of pairing something up with my music isn't a good strategy since it would just be like forcing 2 things together instead of creating something with sound and visuals together that go hand and hand as pa\n rt of a\n whole. I have some songs that I think can stand alone, like more traditional verse/chorus stuff with vocals... but most of my stuff is like weird little instrumental pieces, like 10 seconds to a minute in length, which I don't think would make much sense on their own (when I wrote them I had certain images in mind, like this song reminds me of a mad scientists tinkering with a bunch of test-tubes and bubbling chemicals, this song sounds like you just got \"game over\" in a video game, this song sounds like you just had an idea and a light bulb went off over your head, this song sounds like your taking a walk and then something crazy jumps out in front of you, this one sounds like you tried to do something epic but then failed in an anticlimactic way at the very end, etc)... sorry for this long rambling text. But I just feel like I've been standing in front of the same hurdle for a very long time and have no ideas how to jump over it and it's disheartening. If you have any advi\n ce for m\n e, I'd really appreciate it. Like should I just force myself to try to learn how to make videos, and hope that over time I learn to enjoy it, get better at it, and find my own voice/style? Or should I seek alternate routes (which routes, I don't know) that don't involve me making videos?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
