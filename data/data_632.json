And the reason the word 'liar' is there is, clearly, it's what follows naturally after the line \"when i get younger\". Because obviously no one's gonna get younger. so obviously if you say you've gotten younger then you're presumably a liar. And the way the \"when i get younger\" line comes about, is, just a simple songwriting tactic of taking the already established first line (\"when i get older\") and choosing the natural alternative options. older --> younger. So you can see, the whole existence of the word 'truthful' in that verse is clearly the result of a very logical chain of songwriting best-practices\n<br><br>"
