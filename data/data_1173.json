I like to make projects, cool little events, sometimes a little funny video, perhaps a map to a video game and so on. But for years I've been struggling with three big problems.\n<br>\n<br>First, when thinking about starting a project, I tend to struggle getting it started. In my mind I have this feeling that I know exactly what to do, but starting it just feels exhausting and I don't get things done. How do I kickstart myself to start those projects?\n</qco></h3>      it sounds like you still don't know specifically enough, the first steps. what helps me is to put on my own tv show, even if it's not actually on tv. you are the host of the show, and on the show, you will discuss and figure out how the hell to do the thing you are trying to do. and it will be fun and exciting as the audience follows along with your quest<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, when I get things started, I have this bad trait where I work on projects marathon style. For example, I do something for multiple days nonstop, but if I take even a smallest pause (like one day), the project just freezes instantly. How do I get rid of this marathon mentality?\n</qco></h3>      very specific bookmarks will help. write down exactly where you left off. very very specifically exactly what the next exact thing is.<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, even if things are rolling, sometimes I start to think elsewhere. \"Damn, that's a great idea!\" New projects that I should absolutely do! But there's this other project I'\n m alread\n y working on and that would just give me extra work. How does one simply focus on one project at a time while maintaining other amazing, potential ideas?</qco> </h3>      keep an idea bank. add ideas to it. watch the bank grow out of control\n<br><br>"

For example, if I play C for four beats, then F for four beats, and then G for four beats, it doesn't sound complete until I play G for four more beats. Is there a way to write a song with three chords where each chord is only played for four beats and then the chord regression repeats?</qco> </h3>      the default 'normal' sound, for time, tends to run in powers of 2. so lengths of 2, 4, 8, 16, are all normal sounding lengths.
