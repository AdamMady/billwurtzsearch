But I can probably count on one hand the number of songs that I actually finished and recorded this year. I want to finish my songs. I want a nice base of full, completed, solid recordings. But I LOVE to write, much more than record. The ideas come faster than I can keep up with. I have multiple binders filled with sketched out charts and I don't how many rough audio demos. </qco></h3>"
