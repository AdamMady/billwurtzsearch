If you've made it this far you might be wondering why life has a value when it to is not infinite, and the answer is that life contains some of the infinite nothingness, for example my life is full of infinite nothingness, which is why I'm happy to say that life definitely equals .8\n<br>\nwait am I thinking about this too much?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
