Upon the first viewing of that website, a screen is shown that says \"what's the password\". I, as well as many others who are like me, click on the button that says \" I don't know\" I am seeking the password, as I am very interested in what may lie beyond that wall. I believe that the world will be a better, more loving place if you would disclose this to the public. I am aware that this article may not be publicly displayed on this section of your web page, but I do ask that it may.\nWith love,\n{Z}</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#EE4B4B\">11.14.16&nbsp;\n7:44 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#3A81FF\"> what's the password</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#EE4B4B\">11.2.16&nbsp;\n10:17 am</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#3A81FF\"> what;s the password</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#EE4B4B\">10.14.16&nbsp;\n6:50 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#3A81FF\"> whats the password?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#EE4B4B\">10.9.16&nbsp;\n3:00 am</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#3A81FF\"> what's the password?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#EE4B4B\">10.8.16&nbsp;\n2:33 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#3A81FF\"> what's the password</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#EE4B4B\">10.4.16&nbsp;\n2:29 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#3A81FF\"> tell me the password to reality</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#EE4B4B\">10.2.16&nbsp;\n4:56 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#3A81FF\"> What's the password?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#EE4B4B\">10.1.16&nbsp;\n7:11 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#3A81FF\"> What's the password?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#EE4B4B\">9.30.16&nbsp;\n11:25 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#3A81FF\"> What's the password?????????</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#EE4B4B\">9.26.16&nbsp;\n3:08 am</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#3A81FF\"> what is the password?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#EE4B4B\">9.19.16&nbsp;\n11:27 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#3A81FF\"> What's the password?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#EE4B4B\">9.5.16&nbsp;\n3:30 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#3A81FF\"> What is the password of your reality page?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#EE4B4B\">8.23.16&nbsp;\n1:32 am</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#3A81FF\"> What's the password for your reality thing?</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#EE4B4B\">7.20.16&nbsp;\n6:39 pm</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#3A81FF\"> whats the password</font> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n<br><br><h3> <font color=\"#EE4B4B\">7.12.16&nbsp;\n1:20 am</font> &nbsp;<font color=\"#3A81FF\"> Bill, what is the PASSWORD?!!\nI've been going crazy-stalker mode with many sleepless nights, starving and parched, just trying to get the right password!
