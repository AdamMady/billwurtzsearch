I haven't been diagnosed for any mental disorders but lately I've just been constantly thinking about the fact that I've just moved schools in term 2 of grade 11 and I'm not close to my tiny class of like 10 people and I don't really relate to them as friends. I have an extremely tight group of friends outside of school but I only get to see some on the weekend sometimes. Mum doesn't let me go out of my suburb to see them though that often and most of the time I just have to stay home and talk to them over the phone or text or something. I'm a really introverted person except around my close friends where I really thrive. Around them is the only times I actually feel happy and feel like living. But I only get to feel that way a few days in a month. Every other day is literal hell. I sit in the corner by myself at school listening to music and trudging through ATAR hell and I s\n pend lun\n ch breaks sitting in the corner of the common room buried in beanbags. And I just feel like crying all the time those days and I feel like it's just not worth living at all and I'm so empty and sad. I'm too scared to talk to professional counselors or even like those crisis support hotlines and even my own parents and siblings?? I only talk to that group of friends about how I'm feeling but they can't really help all that much apart from just talking to me where it does improve my mood a little. I find you a really good guy to just vent to as well and I'm sorry to force you to read my sad wall of text but yeah idk what to do and I'm just stuck...\n<br></qco> </h3><br><br>"
