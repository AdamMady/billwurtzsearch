I've tried using GarageBand before, but nothing else ever seems to go with my music, and I'm not sure if I'm just not good at music production (I kinda failed that class at school) or if my songs just shouldn't have any instruments besides piano, but my songs tend to get really boring after a while with no instruments. I've probably said a bit more than needed, but I was wondering... can you give me some tips on adding more effects and instruments to songs?</qco> </h3>"
