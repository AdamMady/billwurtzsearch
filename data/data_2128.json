When you're trying to the 2 week schedule thing, why not post the song (just the audio) on your website when that's finished, as opposed to waiting for the video to be done as well? Do you think the video is more effective/enjoyable if it's a song we haven't heard before? Like, do you think us knowing the song before the video comes out would be like 'spoiling the surprise' or whatever? People liked the movie star video even though that song was posted before the video. Again, I'm not particularly suggesting you do this. Just curious why you've decided against it?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
