    "html": "<h3> <dco>10.12.18&nbsp; \n9:21 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Is pop a genre or is it just a way to categorize the popular songs of the time. Because I feel like the pop genre specifically is one that has really changed over time. Like if you look at songs from the late 2000s early 2010s and compare them to songs from today it's really a surprise to find out that they're the same genre because they're really quite different. Then if you go further back to the 80s for example you see that they're really different from today's music. Now that I think about it this is the same as with other genres as well. So with that being said do genres even exist?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I'm listening to \"closer\" and I want more songs like that and I put on a pop playlist I'm gonna be really surprised when something like \"wake me up before you go go\" comes on because they're so different. So then shouldn't songs not be classified into just genres like pop and rock but rather genres AND their time period like 90s pop or 60s rock. Thoughts?\n\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALSO \n I've been thinking about this - how do you actually write a songs in a certain genre? Like???? What???? What makes a pop song pop or a rock song rock or a metal song metal (I'm talking in terms of just melody lyrics and chords)?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it just the production stage in which a song develops a genre? Like if I wrote a song and then made three different versions, one with synths and shit, one with some heavy guitar, and one with some sick beats, would I have one song in three different genres?\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or just one song? And if I just have one song what genre is that?????? I'm going crazy. How do you think you make a song a certain genre?</qco> </h3>"
