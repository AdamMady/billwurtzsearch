After the event they were left behind. A week passed and I said to my boss \"if they don't come pick these up I might take them for myself\". Fastforward to yesterday and she surprised me with a bag of the 3 tambourines! I had forgotten about them. So I have them in the bag still, saving them for a private function I'll be performing at with a friend in a couple weeks. I got to thinking about the tambourine you're saving for later, is it because you're in an apartment where playing it could possibly be too noisy for current neighbors?</qco> </h3>"
