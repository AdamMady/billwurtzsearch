Fly drones to serve as lane markers and hold up signs? That would be a several metric shit-tons of drones. And I wonder how you'd prevent all the cars from just trying to fly over top of traffic jams and endanger each other? Now you've got a third dimension of regulation to worry about that you didn't have before, far dwarfing the implementation details of today's air traffic control systems since there are so many more cars.
