Remind me etc. would be from key of Db, then from World was younger is from A, so that's 2 more changes there. TV on radio is definitely from Db, then around Stereo/leaves, we're in Bb, then landing on Turquoise we're back in B, so that's 3 more changes. 'Fly around on an airplane' sounds like it would be part of a song in E, then 'business class sec' would be in G, so that's 2 more changes. ants crawl is still G, then the next chord i could make a case for either E, A, or D, but regardless it's definitely a change. then B (turtles.) then on \"streets\" i would argue Db. and just linearly up from there (Eb, then F, then G.). so that's 6 more changes. then somewhere in the midst of 'church holds the key' it slips into C, so that's 1 more change. Then it goes to garbage land on the last line in the chords, but, the melody is still in C so i don't call that a change. so that's 16 changes if i counted correctly, according to what i think counts as a key change. using for sure 9 different keys, at least\n<br><br>"
