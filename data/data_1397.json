I believe I already have anxiety, but I've never seen anyone about it. Writing my paper for history brought me an incredible amount of stress and self-hatred because I knew it wasn't of quality. The rest of the class was enjoyable and the exams were easy, but I didn't really take anything away from it besides the stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;I love history, but what I really want to do is to is to write… fiction… movies. I do want to write about history, mostly about the history of American folk music, but I don't know if I want history to be more of a hobby than a career. I also took a required Drama class and just got 100%con my final. I enjoyed it so much. We talked about and examined theatre plays and I loved it so much more than my history class.
