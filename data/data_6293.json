Later never comes because the devs ran out of time or were bad at their jobs. I'm an amateur web dev and I'd never heard of this preference. The applause that followed your remark surprised me. Surely your niche opinion on software was not already widely held by that audience;&nbsp;as you had said yourself in what I believe were your initial writings on the matter, you felt that you had held this question subconsciously for a long time before you could express it. But the applause also made sense on a different level. I feel like we all hate the mouse deep in our hearts.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t Anyway so I looked it up and found out about the principle of keyboard comp\n atibilit\n y, which is similarly that all software should be accessible via keyboard because many people aren't able to use a mouse due to a disability. Not sure whether you knew that, but either way, it's a good opinion to be promoting and I'm glad I'm now a slightly less ignorant amateur web dev.</qco> </h3>"
