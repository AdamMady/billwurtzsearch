It's like I forget how awesome the ideas felt to me when I came up with them. I've tried your strategy of just cateloging and recording every damn thing I think of, but I never end up going back to listen to them, and meanwhile I'm neck deepin something else that caught my attention, whether it's figuring out how the fuck math works, how the fuck computers work, how the fuck communication (e.g. talking politely, teaching) works, and also how the fuck the world works. </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   realize of bad habits to have, this is definitely not the worst I could have. But it's just so fucking annoying when you are going to bed at 2 in the morning to wake up for school at 6:30 and you feel like you\n've done\n nothing of substance, big and meaningful. Like I could be doing so much more, making the world just a little more cooler (I'd like to think), but just controlling the urge to swim deeper into the ocean even though you just dragged yourself out of the deep end is hard somehow. I can't shift from thinking \"But what? But why?\" to \"time to make shit.\"\n<br>\n<br>And really? I'm realizing that I'm okay with myself still humming a long, looking at and thinking about interesting stuff, because at the end of the day it is fun. But how exactly can I keep this up forever?&nbsp;&nbsp;This is fun, but I've kind of had the same kind of fun for a while now. Can I please just switch? </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I'm honestly kind of just insecure, because now I'm just thinking, do I even know what I'm saying right now? Is it really that big of a deal? Even when my thoughts are trying to say otherwise. There is a disconnect here between feelings and thought, and I'm not sure what is going on. And no, those were not th\ne good w\nords to use there...that's not quite what I meant to say... I'm not sure if it's just sleep dep. making everything wobbly and unfocused, or my brain purposely trying not to think about this.\n<br>\n<br>I hate the feeling when I see both people that I follow online and people around me actually doing things, </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  nd when other people around me are like \"dude just be lazy and stop caring so much\" IF I CARE SO MUCH WHY AM I GOING TO BED AT 3 JUST TO FINISH A GOD DAMN SCHOOL ASSIGNMENT well, let me take that back. I didn't start until 1, but I could have finished much earlier if I would have just half-assed it which would still have gotten me an A. And I was running away from starting it because I had no idea how to do it.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \nI'm trying to learn Debussy's L'isle Joyeuse over the summer, attempting to make a karaoke track to \"and the day goes on\" with a DS soundfont I have, digitizing a Bible of sorts (not religious) with cool layout, pictures, and design, making a movie with\n my frie\nnd starring King Lear, and creating computer programs to help with scheduling. (There's a circle here somewhere...) Oh, and writing college essays. The sad thing is, there is more than enough time to do all this stuff, and more time to do more, during the summer. I know this. Everything would be great if I actually worked on it, instead I'm not. And I know the answer to this is that I'm on the right track, or that there is a tipping point. It's just so frustrating, and scary, because I don't know if I want to see myself if I ever go past that tipping point.\n<br>\n<br>I don't want to be boxed into everything. But I'm kind of wondering if I do need some sort of box to be able to continuously work on stuff.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I can't think of really a whole project to finish in a day, like your schedule when you were starting.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \nSorry, this kinda like turned into many different issues. I can't even lay a finger on a specific problem I'm having. Hate to bother you with this, but it's jus\nt a big \nfrustration for me that I haven't changed. Well, that's not true, I have changed a little, I'm looking at *literal* trash less often...\n<br>\n<br>Even if you don't reply, thanks for being an outlet for my thoughts. Sorry for this huge mess of a ramble, I'm also very tired, as I'm sure you are too.\n<br>\n<br>-IronLotus</qco> </h3>"
