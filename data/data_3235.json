Given everything I've learned about you, you seem to be attempting to convey a special perspective/attitude about things to the world, a perspective that is very important to you because of its sincerity, optimism, power, and profound inspiration. I have not seen many people, if at all, with quite the goal you have, before I found out about you. And that is extremely inspiring and validating to me, because I had often felt like I was the only one who had this special, sincere, optimistic, powerful perspective on things, and who wanted to share this perspective with the world to make the world more open and joyous. I have, like you, found it extraordinary difficult, in fact impossible, to find people who I actually connect with, and I seriously believe it's because nobody quite has the perspective I do on things. Just wanted to tell you about how I think there are people li\n ke you out there. If my perspective/attitude about things is the same as yours, which I feel like it essentially is, then you can rest assured that there are other people helping share this perspective with everyone. I appreciate the fact that you exist and you are also helping lift up the world this way. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, are there some things you learned that you wished you knew when attempting to convey this....thing.....to everyone?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
