It seems simple - \"just answer the question, and that answer is the thing that motivates you\" - but that's not the problem. I know why I need to do it. I know that doing the thing, whatever it is, is the most logically, emotionally, and/or spiritually satifying thing I can do right now, the thing I'll look back on and say \"I'm glad I did that thing.\" It is the best thing to do in every regard, except one: doing the thing will make the right now go from being okay to feeling sucky, and that just sets the rest of my brain in a tizzy, and I try to fight against it but my inner fatass always wins. So, Bill Wurtz, I ask you, how do I garner the mental power to stop my griping and groaning and just do the sucky thing already?</qco> </h3><br><br>"

I love playing video games, listening to music, writing and watching YouTube but I also want to be a musician or an artist. A creator of something. To me, these things are all very important to me. They inspire me and make me happy. But I can't stand this path anymore. It makes me sad. The people that surround me kind of kill my creative aspirations in life. I want to do these great things that I dream of everyday. I just don't know where to start. I don't know where to go with all the people that surround me deterring me of my dreams and creativity. Any advice or suggestions for me? I'd appreciate it. -T</qco> </h3><br><br>"
