If you listen to the track, this may seem surprising;&nbsp;the music isn't what one might associate with such tragedy. People in the comment section are grappling as to whether or not this is 'sad' music, and trying to comprehend what a confusing feeling it is to listen. There is some consensus that this really just 'neutral' music, meant to convey the idea that death is neutral. This is how I myself understand it.\n<br>There is one individual however, who is dead insistent and a bit aggressive that this is JOYOUS music simply because music theory says so. Major key == happy. Case closed. The fact that one is reminded of something separate should not be considered...\n<br>This blunt use of music theory stresses me out a bit. Is that somewhat true? Or not? </qco></h3>"
