And then the classic question from that would be \"well who made their universe?\" And then I'd think that it was 'programmed' in an even simpler and more logical universe that has the capacity to create a slightly more complex one and that it would keep going that way until you get to a universe that's a hypothetical idea, like an exact representation of logic.
