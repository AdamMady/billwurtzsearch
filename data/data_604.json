'outside'<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- \"change my ways / Oh and I'm\" is a bar of 7 again, but this time I'm not certain it's back to 4 on \"leaving.\" [Actually wait, I think it is, it's just that the little triplet-sounding keyboard melody and the bass slide both happen on beats that I don't understand?]\n</qco></h3>      all of that stuff in there ignores the time. but it does click through as 2 full bars, after \"plane\" being on the & of 4. there is a percussion click squarely on beat 3 of the second bar to set you up for the chorus <h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's all. Big big thanks in advance if you are able to answer this &lt;3)\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></qco> </h3>      \n\n\n\n<br><br>"
