However, I've more recently begun studying some (rather simple) jazz standards from the Real Book. Often, I have to practice playing the right hand melody of a piece, while playing the chords in the left hand. Usually, getting the right hand melody isn't too difficult, but it can be really challenging for me to get the chords in the left hand. It's not that I don't know the chords-most of the chords I can figure out-but that it takes me some time to figure a lot of them out; there's a whole process of analysis of the musical chord notation in front of me before I actually play the chord. This makes it so that, unless I \"cheat\" by writing in the names of the notes of some chords in the music, I have to stop my playing, figure out the chord, and resume playing. Do you have any tips on improving sight-reading when playing melody + chords? Is this just something that gradually improves with practice?</qco> </h3>"
