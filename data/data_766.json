I lose my place every time. I slowed down the audio on Youtube and tried to count along, and the best I could come up with is (1)e triplet 2e&amp;a (3)&amp;a (4)e&amp;, but the note D is halfway between 4 and e. And the sixteenths are slightly swung, right? I'm so confused, will you explain the rhythm? </qco></h3><a href=\"rhyth.png\" target=\"_blank\">sure</a><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also, will you explain how you came up with this rhythm, if you have time?</qco> </h3>"
