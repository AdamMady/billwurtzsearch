Pretend you have to explain it to them so that they can reproduce the idea exactly, but, you are not allowed to actually demonstrate it. For example, if it's a sentence, say \"the first word is ___, the second word is ____,\" etc... Count the words. remind yourself how many words there are. Say all the odd numbered words. Say all the even numbered words. Think of the first letter of each word, and put all those letters together. try to come up with an alternate sentence using the same starting letters. Try to access the idea in as many different ways as you can. If it is a musical idea, start thinking of the notation of it, imagine you are explaining the musical notation to someone else without singing it. List the notes in order. Count the notes. List the rhythmic values in order. If you don't know musical notation in this way, hopefully you have some other conceptual notation system you use to think about notes and time. What tempo is it? what song has a similar tempo? how many notes are in the first beat? how many notes are in the second beat? etc etc etc. Keep trying to access the idea on as many mental avenues as you can, and this will increase the likelyhood that you will be able to retrieve it. However, ...... if you've really just had the idea of a lifetime, and your life depends on it, then you can get out of the shower immediately and go write it down. it's a good feeling to know you have that level of professionalism\n\n<br><br>"
