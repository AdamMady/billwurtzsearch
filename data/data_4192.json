Fm6 wants to resolve to C, G7 and G7b9 want to resolve to C, or to Cm, or if you get sneaky they might go to Am or A, or even F# in some cases. and you look at the common notes here: D, F, Ab, B like to go to chords with their root on C, Eb, F#, A. and a lot of things can be explained by this pattern of minor third series.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t so i thought about your answer and how maybe it could fill some holes in my theory, like how Gsus4 likes to go to G, or how Eaug7 likes to go to E7 before it goes to Am, but ultimately i do not understand why what you said would be true. i know it was a long t\n ime ago \n but if you could explain why you might have said that i would appreciate the closure</qco> </h3><br><br>"
