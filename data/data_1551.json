I was wondering: I discovered your reality videos last summer, and I kind of understood, reading some of the questions page, that they were old recording that you edit many years after, and post online maybe even later. I thought I read somewhere that you posted a new one every friday, but I'm not sure I understood right, since I come regularly to see if there are any updates, and I haven't seen new entries lately.\n</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\tWhat's the process for the reality videos? \n</qco></h3><a href=\"reality-search.png\">this</a><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\tI find them super super super interesting. I'm in the middle of a very very huge projet that I know it will work and I'm extremely excited about how it will turn out, but at the same time absolutely terrified at the colossal amount of work it represents. So I relate to those video you made, while you were working on HOTEWIG. (thanks) - good luck for your current projet! It's gonna be hard, but it's gonna be worth it</qco> </h3>"
