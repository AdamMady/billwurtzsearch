Before the pandemic, i was in AP classes and was one of the smarter students in the class, but as soon as i started home school, my grades dropped to Cs. I want to succeed and learn. I love learning but my teachers cant teach us when we are home the same way. Id learn one thing maybe every week for every teacher but i would learn nothing for like a week after. This isnt motivation enough to want to make me keep my grades up. Why would i care to keep my grades up when im learning pretty much nothing and my teachers don't motivate me. So to summarize, i used to be a good student, then when covid hit, my grades dropped to shit and i cant find motivation to keep them up. I want to have a good GPA but even when i do really try, i end up flunking tests or essays. Do you have any advice on this?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
