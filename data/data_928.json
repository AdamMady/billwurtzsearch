However, (and this was unclear to me from your description) if the old 16th note needs to become the new 8th note (in 12/8) then you can write sixteenth note equals eighth note. Or if you use 12/16 you don't need any conversion. it will also be assumed that it's grouped in 3s if you beam them that way\n<br><br>"
