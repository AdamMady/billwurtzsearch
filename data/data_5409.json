With quarantine, things just got worse and it honestly feels like I'll never find my way out of this place, out of their influence. I'm about to turn 18 and next year I should be heading to college. However, I can't go anywhere out of state because my parents say they won't pay for it, but they do have the money to do so, which means I can't apply for any financial aid. So I'm basically an adult now, but I can't begin to act like one because I have neither money nor a car or anything. I've just wanted to break free for as long as I can remember, and for the last few years I kept myself studying hard considering that'd provide for me, it would give me a way out. But now that the time has actually come for me to go to college, and I realize I don't have any passions anymore and the only thing that's left is a escape, which it won't provide either. Everyday I h\n ear more sarcastic comments about how everything I do is flawed and I'm never enough and I just don't want to keep doing this, taking everything they say to me. And I genuinely can't see this going on for more 5 years or so, till I finish college and get a job, without me completely falling apart. I just don't know how long I'll be able to hold on. I feel hopeless. Do you happen to have any kind words?</qco> </h3>"
