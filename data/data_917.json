CAUTION: this only works on people who can read well enough to do this. which is fewer and fewer people, as recording devices become more and more readily available. Advantage of notation, is that you can read while you are playing, where as you can't really play something from a recording in real-time. Advantages to recording, you can record the music much more accurately, and express things that would be impossible to fully explain in notation\n<br><br>"
