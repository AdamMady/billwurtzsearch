I have been working at this job for nearly 4 months and management is considering promoting me to chief position. I'm not in STEM field. And this job is tiring as is and i can't even imagine dealing with a lot more work load on top of that. What i'll get in return (money) won't be worth it i think (it's not much of a difference than what i get now). What do you think? What should i do? Should i say no to their proposal?</qco> </h3>"

But it's a serious rut. because obviously listening to your music there's a whole other thing to it which i interpret as \"sparse-ness\". Meaning EVERY note can MATTER and hold serious weight leading into wherever it goes. I just suppose this anyway...But for Years i couldn't begin to understand the logic to it. Meanwhile, I plowed through a harmony book. learned about all these cool chords Outside of the major scale that relate to the major scale. and implement them as well as fun time signatures into my work in a way that was organic and good. but i still do the dumb chord thing. and so like a year ago to h\n opefully\n  evolve and understand why I needed to change I started transcribing pop songs i enjoyed, completely. even maracas for like one upbeat on a single measure. So I think my ear is getting better because of that. i mean it might be ridiculous. considering i'm sure even the players for \"running on empty\"-jackson browne were looking at Much simpler charts than what they actually played. but i insist on doing it. Anyway! So all this time passes in my development and i still feel like i'd immediately fall face first if i were let out in the real world because of the chord thing.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t throughout all this time i would ask people \"how do i get out of this habit, how do i change?\" and they said almost every time \"...just do it? there's literally nothing stopping you.\" which seemed kind of asshole-ish. cuz it didn't really seem like advice. but lo and behold, last night i just \"did it\" and i can't explain how i \"did it\". i just did. the comping/voice leading was beautiful. it was honestly jus\n t a deci\n sion to do it.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t and it kind of pisses me off because i could've done this THE WHOLE TIME!! but i literally can't explain it. it's ethereal. something fundamental in ME must've changed, or something. have you ever experienced anything like this?</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t not even just music but like being in a situation where \"there's a thing you want to do, you know what it is you gotta do, but something peculiarly vague in your bones is holding you back\"?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"

Over 14 million acres have been burnt. That's twice the size of Belgium. It's scary and hard to comprehend.\n<br>I'm lucky enough not to be affected but I feel dreadful not being able to help. I've managed to donate $130 dollars but it feels like nothing. It wouldnt even scratch the surface. It might put fuel in 2 cars with small tanks. It can't buy even a cheap firefighting pump, or hardly any livestock feed, or other necessities like that. It brings me to tears knowing I'm capable of so little because of my lack of money. Sometimes I wish I were rich, purely for the ability to fucking help more and make an actual difference. \n<br>Sorry, I just had to vent a bit. I can't express these feelings to people around me because ffs, these selfish issues are nothing compared with w\n hat the \n people affected are dealing with and it's childish of me to think like this.
