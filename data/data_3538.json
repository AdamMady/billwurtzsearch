(I'm not wrong, CHECK any of those pages and see for yourself. billwurtz.com/reality for example) So that means you have at least once been awake in all those hours, and thus all hours (and most presumably minutes) of the day AND night. I know you sleep, because sleep is important (and multiple people already asked if you sleep), but my conclusion after seeing all these hours of the day AND night was: sometimes you sleep in the daytime, and sometimes you sleep at night, ANY hour, you name it, you have at least once been both awake and asleep (not on the same day) in that hour. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normal people sleep ONLY, EXCLUSIVELY at night. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thing is, I want to so\n metimes \n sleep in the daytime, and sometimes sleep at night like you, because I'm sick of the normal sleep-at-night routine, and I want to break the day-to-day loop. There's only one problem. When I sleep, I feel like I've skipped a certain period of time (usually 8 hours). This is caused by my brain being unconscious. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However this only works at night for some reason. (I know what I said earlier, normal people sleep ONLY, EXCLUSIVELY at night, but I myself, in particular, can't deal with being stuck in the routine every day. It just feels like an infinite loop, and I'm sick of it.) Anyway, my question is: HOW do you sleep in the daytime (or did in 2008-2016 for example if you do not anymore)? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried this, but I ended up being awake, bored, and with nothing to do for 8 hours, and I just keep telling myself to go to sleep until my sleep time period is over, and I tried my hardest to become unconcious, but nothing worked, so I had to wait out the time period minute by minute. Second by\n  second.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  I repeat, my question is: HOW do you sleep in the daytime (or did in 2008-2016 for example if you do not anymore)?</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you decide to not post this question, PLEASE answer this question, because this is a serious issue, and I'm fed up with the normal only-at-night sleep schedule. And don't just decide to respond with \"good god this must have taken ages to write\" or anything off-topic. ANSWER the question, and tell all of us how you sleep/slept so unpredictably (sometimes in the daytime, sometimes at night),</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because, again, this is a serious issue (at least on my part), I'm fed up with the standard sleep-at-night day-to-day routine. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I'll repeat the main question at the end of this question so people reading this question don't get confused. How do/did you sleep so unpredictably?</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm specifically asking for how you sleep in the daytime? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO FUNNY ANSWERS LIKE THE 13 LEVELS OF SUFFERING THING.
