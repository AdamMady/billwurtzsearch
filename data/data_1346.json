If roots aren't connected, some fungi can transfer the signal. The closer relative the other plant is, the clearer the communication. These messages are usually about the environment and slowly advancing dangers. Quickly advancing dangers (animals eating plants) use hormones and wind. Since these responses are to dangers, plants \"feel\", but as far as we know, not emotions. \n<br>\n<br>We have the questions page bookmarked on our homescreens, we like to explore your really awesome project of a website together:) we know it isn't a question, but it's 3:20AM and we couldn't help but chime in:)&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
