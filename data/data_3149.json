The la de da part sounds happy. Combine this with the meaningless of the lyrics, this means happiness without reason. \n</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---Genuine happiness is actually rare this days. Yes, we often feel happy, like when we just won a game match, or we get a promotion at work, but that happiness is only temporary. If the condition changes (like we lose the next game, or someone accidentally hit our car when we're going home from work) we will no longer be happy\n<br>---Gen\n uine happiness, on the other hand, doesn't have a reason. it's being happy simply because we existed. It's a feeling of being grateful because we're still here, regardless on the situation. This is what we all wanted. The words \"When will you come back home\" expresses our search for this happiness, as we continue to wait for happiness to come to us. \n</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lines\n<br>Then I built some trains\n<br>And I'm travelling somewhere new\n<br>It's a wonderful world, but\n<br>Still no you\n<br>It's a wonderful world for two\n<br>expresses our believes that if we have wealth, career, love, fame, or all those other things, we can be genuinely happy, but that isn't true. we don't need all of that. Genuine happiness is as simple as being happy, but we struggle to find that, like how we don't understand simple words like \"la de da de yo\"\n</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just got home got no home\n<br>La de da d-de where did it go?\n<br>Oh no\n<br>I can't go home.\n<br>\n<br>--- I believe this is an exp\n ression \n on how we believe that we don't have happiness, when it's really it's just there. Kinda like how Bill wrote \"Got no home\" While he, definitely, have a home. We believe we don't have happiness, while it's really just there, waiting us to come back home. \n</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think about my analysis?
