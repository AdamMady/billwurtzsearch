BUT t\n he misconceptions about aspergers remain. even with new people in my life, some of these people still think autistic = retarded / incapable of anything except math. i feel bad because by shutting up about my diagnosis i am not helping other who still get discriminated. should i 'come out' again as having aspergers? so that people will know people with aspgergers actually all have a different personality that is build up of many layers just like everybody else?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
