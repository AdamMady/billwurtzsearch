How do I stop this and truly thrive as myself? I feel like the vision of life I'd found once was amazing, truly beautiful, but now I'm just filled with doubts and worries and devoid of wonder and love and fun. I don't want to grow up and live a typical life and die having wasted my time to make change on this earth.&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
