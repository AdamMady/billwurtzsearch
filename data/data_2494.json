So far I think it's a really strong story and I'm excited about it and I want to tell it. But I'm worried about portraying my inspiration I guess? Like part of me is worried about how they'll perceive how I perceive them? Do you get what I mean? I know logically they wont hate me or be mad at me or anything for simply writing made up stuff. And it's not like the characters or story is malicious or anything. It's just. You know. My feelings and thoughts are kind of driving it. Im nervous about it not living inside my head anymore. Umm I'm not really sure how to wrap this up into a coherent question.
