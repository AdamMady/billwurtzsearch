I was wondering what thought goes behind these moments.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br>Additionally, I was curious whether you have nicknames for certain sounds that you use (I admit that I do and am quite partial to alien trumpet, grumpy duck, etc.) I tend to personify sounds when I compose and that personality bleeds through into the parts they encompass, especially in the realm of synthesis where pre-established emotional connotations for sounds don't exist where they do for other instruments.</qco> </h3>"
