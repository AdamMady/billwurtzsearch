It's like the things I most want to express are the things that are hardest for me to put into words, and I've never been much for writing poetry and stories and stuff, which I know is a different ball game than lyric writing.. but still, I've never considered myself a 'writer'... writing words has just never been my strong suit creatively. I feel like if I could just get more\n comfort\nable with lyrics, then I could churn out songs like a machine.
