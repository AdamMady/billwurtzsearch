But when i shorten up the attack and release, then that very quickly turns it into something that is delightful for me to play, as a keyboard player. Another thing you can do is program in something on one of the wheel controls. my 2 favorite options for this are filter cutoff (wawawawaw), and vibrato. To do a nice vibrato the way i like, set the LFO to somewhere around 4x per second, then make the LFO control the pitch up and down, then, set the wheel to increase the depth of the LFO as you push the wheel up. If you have things on the wheels then i think you're gonna have a lot of fun and be able to express yourself really well\n<br><br>"
