So the fear was that some terribly unexpected stuff may happen around the world as a result of all the computer systems suddenly thinking it's 1900, instead of 2000. there was a widespread fear that everything would break down. but luckily, through hard work i think, most of the important systems managed to get fixed in time, so there really wasn't any huge catastrophe. This issue was known as the \"Y2K\" issue, but besides that, Y2K was actually just a nickname for the year 2000. so essentially, Y2K means the year 2000. hope that helps\n<br><br>"
