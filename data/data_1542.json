I have lots of music on my archive that i've collected over the course of 20 years and that i deeply care about (i hate all sorts of streaming sites). And i've put a lot of effort into shaping my music directory and now i am looking at it thinking if i can use more simplified method.\n<br>\n<br>My music directory goes like this:\n<br>I have a main music directory named 'Music'. And then, this directory divides into the music genres, and then into subgenres, then into artists, then into albums (if there's any). Then you find mp3/flac files in those directories. If a song of said artist doesn't belong to any album (ie. single song, etc) it goes into directory named 'singles' in the artist's directory. Also, any songs whose artists i have only one song of, they go to the another directory named 'Singles' in the proper genre/subgenre.\n<br>\n<br>For example, if i wanna listen t\n o Michae\n l Jackson's Billie Jean, the path i have to go thru is Music -&gt; Pop -&gt; Michael Jackson - &gt; Thriller, because i have the entire album. \n<br>\n<br>Or, 'Zhi-Vago - Celebrate the Love (Club Mix)' is in Music -&gt; Electronic Music -&gt; Trance -&gt; Dream Trance -&gt; Singles, because it's the only song i have of Zhi-Vago.\n<br>\n<br>When you look at it, it really is good method. All songs from all artists in the same genre is in one place. It makes it easier to listen in Winamp. UNLESS artist have many songs from many different music genres. That's the frustrating part.\n<br>\n<br>Do you think this method is good?</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t How did you do yours? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\tAnd your thoughts in general? Thanks.</qco> </h3>"
