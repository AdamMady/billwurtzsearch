Like, to be fair I have built up a tolerance for more experimental music with a lot going on, but I feel like your music is so artfully made yet it doesn't feel like it takes any energy to be able to digest it. Quite the opposite. It has the feel-good energy of a pop song that you can just jam out to, while also being so unique and filled with so many details and elements you might find in jazz fusion or other genres. Maybe it's just how my brain works, but do you have any thoughts on this? Does it just have to do with your influences and your own taste, or is there something intentional about this balance?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
