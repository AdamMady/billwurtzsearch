(I'm not wrong, CHECK any of those pages and see for yourself. billwurtz.com/reality for example) So that means you have at least once been awake in all those hours, and thus all hours (and most presumably minutes) of the day AND night. I know you sleep, because sleep is important (and multiple people already asked if you sleep), but my conclusion after seeing all these hours of the day AND night was: sometimes you sleep in the daytime, and sometimes you sleep at night, ANY hour, you name it, you have at least once been both awake and asleep (not on the same day) in that hour. </qco></h3>"
