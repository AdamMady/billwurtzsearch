Thing is I realize lots of people feel that way so it's not like I couldn't fit in somewhere eventually. So why is it so hard to let go of this mentality? It's dumb because I want to be included and have friends and stuff but I never seem to allow myself to be part of the group. Like I tell myself stuff like I know they don't really want me here even though they're totally the ones who invited me! What's up with that? I'm tired of living like this. I guess what I'm really asking is how do you genuinely chill around other people and actually enjoy it?</qco> </h3>"
