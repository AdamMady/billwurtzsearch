I would just mash together random keys on my keyboard and decide whether it sounds good to me or not. Because of that I've decided to learn the names of many different chords. I found a very useful website a few hours ago that's all about music stuff, mainly chords. I played around with my keyboard and I wrote down my own definitions of different kinds of chords (add,dim,aug and sus). What should I learn about next now that I'm done with the names of the chords?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
