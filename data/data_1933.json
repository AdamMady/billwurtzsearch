    "html": "<h3> <dco>5.8.18&nbsp; \n8:54 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> One of the few times I have ever experienced something truly different was at a concert a few years ago, when the person organizing everything told the audience beforehand that the foreign instruments we were about to hear would sound strange to our ears, but that they were supposed to sound like that. They weren't out of tune or anything, they were simply from a context where musical beauty is something else than it is here.\n<br>\n<br>There is so much out there, so many instruments, so many ways to make music, that all fall outside what \"we\" even think of as \"instruments\" and \"music\". It feels like an insult to the world when people within a certain context points at something and calls it new or different, when it's clearly derived. It is always derived. Never new, and never different.\n<br>\n<br>This is why your easy-going supposedly theory-defying persona on this page is so provoking. If you had the slightest idea of the kind of superhumanly free innovation everything you say on here is actually hinting to, you wouldn't be saying it, because you never do as you say you (aspire to) do.\n<br>\n<br>For example, you use the word \"anything\" a lot, as in \"do anything\" -- yet you basically make music by the book, music that is always somehow firmly rooted in the schools, traditions, rules and conventions of your culture, directly or indirectly. You may think otherwise, but in that case you are wrong. Making music and videos that tend to stand out somewhat in your own narrow sliver of cultural context is no way near actually embracing a theory that says \"you can do anything in music\". Cut the \"anything\" crap. It's grandiose and pathetic.\n<br>\n<br>You make great music, but your ambition put into (your own) words is some unreasonable hubris shit.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
