If there isn't one, and this \"simulation\" just exists on its own somehow, that would mean the distinction between \"real\" and \"simulation\" would be completely arbitrary. so there's another universe that runs this one. but if that's the case, that universe would be the \"real\" one, and you still run into the same issues that the simulation theory is trying to solve, because how did that universe come into being? is it ALSO a simulation? what about the universe controlling that simulation? you can't just keep going on infinitely, eventually you have to come across the \"original\" universe. but anyway... what are your thoughts on this</qco> </h3><br><br>"
