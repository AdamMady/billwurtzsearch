So, I've reached that point in life in which I should know where I'm heading for, but I don't. I'm seventeen and apparently yesterday I couldn't choose what I'd have for lunch, but today I'm supposed to decide what to do for the rest of my life? </qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there's no reason you should have to do that today. You may have known some of it since you were 6, and you may not find some of it until you are 96<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I've had this idea in the back of my mind for years, but I feel like I used to be scared of not knowing what to do and now I'm just kinda scared of knowing I don't want to do anything. Growing up, I've developed real interst in mathematics and languages, and I always thought I'd do something related to one of these areas. But now that I actually have to choose, I don't want either.</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you don't have to choose. those are both cool things, and they are allowed to be in your life, as much or little as you want<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in a developing country and everything is focused in applicability: maths and languages courses are too much about applied knowledge, never seen as pure areas of study. The reason why I fell in love with maths and languages in the first place was by overanalyzing things that have no real impact in the world: I liked that they were beautiful on their own, with no need to ever be used. And the prospects for me are really negative from this point on, because I feel like every college I go to and every job available for me will be quite the opposite of that. I wish I lived in the US or Europe where pure sciences actually exist, but I don't, and I can't afford to go these places. I feel like there's nothing I want to do with the rest of my life, and yet my parents say I have to choose soon because I gotta make money somehow.</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think you will still get a chance to do many things with your life, besides the things you do for employment. Sure, make some decisions on that now, but just make the best decision you can, based on the information you have. even if if you don't have all the information. Because you are obviously still missing at least half of the information. most people are. but you will find a lot of that information along the way. And either one you choose, you'll probably learn something.  and also keep in mind that some of the most powerful things to be learned, may come from outside the 'curriculum'<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I know this completely out of the scope of this page, I just really needed someone to talk to. I guess my question is \"what should I do given that I'm a broken piece in the machine of human existence and don't seem to have any use to anyone or be able to perform any useful service to humanity, however small?\"</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just taking a quick glance at the big picture here, just on the page here, it appears you seem to have some writing skills. which i can guarantee is a useful skill, in many many ways, and is still alive and thriving especially now in the internet age\n\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n8:43 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> why were your videos so short in 2014-2016? i know you posted all those videos go vine back then, but some of them were literally just a single word, like hibernate, yes, test, no, whatever, sheep, bread, tape, africa, song: hello, earth, colonization, quit, ], ]], etc.</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;making entire songs and videos by yourself is a pretty ridiculous task. especially if you care as much about them as i do. So it's a pretty big mindfuck. After being mindfucked for about 10 years and still not being able to do it, i found 1 weird trick which industry professionals HATE which is to start doing insanely short pieces. it helps you actually learn how to do stuff, because you get to every department before getting exhausted<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also why were you so random</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be an example of something less 'random'\n\n\n\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n7:41 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> on expert mode, it says that there was a video called \"VACATIONING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUN\"</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that's not true<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; made in 1.2.20 with no link to it. Was this a video you made in 2020 that you just deleted or privated? Or was this just a teaser for \"here comes the sun\" that you decided to put on this website last year?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nthis is probably why it's called the expert page. the inclusion of different types of content can get a bit dicey for some readers. Where as, a page like the \"videos\" page might be a little easier because you know what kind of content you're getting, and the rules are a bit more firmly established\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n7:26 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> i really love visiting this page because sometimes i need to hear wisdom from someone like you who is creative and knows how to think outside of the box. you tend to answer things in a way that just clicks with my brain. you say some things in such a straight forward and simple way and it makes me go, ah, there it is. the thing i needed to hear. Thanks for everything, i owe you my life</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\npay someone else instead, with wisdom, if they need it. Or, you can try giving wisdom to someone who doesn't want wisdom but you may have to disguise the wisdom\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n7:25 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Is it possible to output art in numerous forms and continually take on projects that are stupidly ambitious all the time and be successful? </qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes but there might also be a lot of personal failures mixed in<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also is it reasonable to try and make 3D galleries in games into a respected medium?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nsure\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n6:11 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Where were you when you discovered that A7 b9 is also Gdim7/A</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nat home, for sure\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n6:08 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> are you planning on ever making a whole album?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\ni would prefer to release the songs individually, and do many more than would normally go on an album\n\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n4:58 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> when will darkness cover the earth?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nat night it tends to cover half\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n4:02 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> how do you answer so many queries?

Then if someone asks, later, 'can you explain your reasoning on going through that door', then you might say that you were just trying to be reasonable. hopefully you see what i'm getting at\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n1:10 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> what is the least complicated word you know</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\ni don't know any complicated words\n\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n12:18 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> are you planning on ever making a whole album?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nno, but i'm planning on making many more songs than could ever fit on an album\n\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n11:37 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> what's the biggest prime number?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nbackstreet boys voice: \"it's gotta be you\"\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n11:13 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> hey bill, on one of your interview you talked about how pretty much every piece of software should have shortcuts for everything...</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i've retracted that sentiment once i realized how many keyboards you'd need to make that work. But, i now firmly believe that all programs need to be scriptable, so that if you do choose to have a million keyboards, you can make use of them, and customize your workflow<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reaper daw has that, along with scripting too... just wanted to let you know...\n<br></qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nyes i know. i really need to switch to it. unfortunately there's never a good time to put the production schedule on pause for several more months. in the meantime, if anyone out there is in the mood to help me find some commands (from xraym's resources, probably) that would be helpful. Here's a major one: how to select the midi note nearest to the playhead, regardless of what track it's on, and play the sound of that note. then another script to travel to the next midi note forward in time, regardless of track, and play the sound of that one. Then another script to select the track of that note, and open the midi editor, with that note selected, and visible on the screen with a reasonable zoom range\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n10:27 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> when do you think your next song is gonna come out?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nsoon\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n9:30 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Is the video you're working on right now any good?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nmaybe\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n9:20 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> if a \"subtle characteristic\" is a \"subtlety\" then an \"obvious characteristic\" is ???</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\na trait\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n8:45 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> what is art?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nyour mind\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n2:34 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> what is the total number of songs that you've written?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\ni'm not sure\n<br><br><h3> <dco>3.19.21&nbsp; \n2:13 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Whats your favourite game\n<br></qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nthe game making game\n</div>"
