But there's also an infinite number of numbers, with an infinite number of subdivisions between each number.... So that's a bigger version of infinity than the subdivisions between 0 and 1? How does that work? How can something be bigger than infinity? If you take all the subdivisions between 0-2, you'd have an infinite number of subdivisions... but the number of subdivisions between 0-1 would be that 0-2 'version' of infinity, divided by 2? You can't divide infinity by 2 can you? I'm confused. Please help?&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
