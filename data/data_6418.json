My grades are great and I have plenty of friends, but I feel terrible. My life is pretty good, but... I don't really have hobbies or personal projects that I do. It makes me feel super unaccomplished.\n<br>\n<br>All I'm acheiving are some numbers in a grade book for some distant promise that I can use them to get a decent job. That's it, that's my life. I study and I get good grades. It frustrates me to no end. I want something unique to me! I'm not going to be in high school forever, and I want something to carry with me to college and beyond.\n<br>\n<br>What I'm asking is if you have struggled with similar things, and how you overcame them. Or if you haven't, since you seem to have been passionate about music from day 1, how can I start working on me? It's a big big world and I don't even know where to start!</qco> </h3>"
