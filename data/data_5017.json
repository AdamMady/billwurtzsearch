Like, at this point my life may as well be homework, which is horrible, because I don't have time to do what I really wanna do, and yet I still manage to procrastinate away my homework (because I hate it), getting nothing of any type done. There's SO much I wanna do in terms of songs and videos and expressing a billion things to every human alive, but I just...... can't. I know I wanna do that for the rest of my life, that much is certain, but that's not exactly a smart move if I wanna..... you know..... have literally any money to live. So, what should I do?
