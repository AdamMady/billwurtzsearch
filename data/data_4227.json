I'm responsible for the vocals, and have as of now composed about 75% of the vocal melodies. But I have no idea what to do about lyrics. Long story short, I only have 2 weekends, 3 weekends max to write lyrics, finish writing vocal melodies, and record the vocal parts. I've tried in vain to get a jump start on the lyrics but I feel absolutely stuck. I don't want to vomit out nonsense filler words (this will likely be the last thing my band ever records/releases, as I am moving across the ocean next month). I just can't seem to generate anything remotely meaningful. And I want it to be. Have you struggled with writing lyrics you were happy with? Any suggestions?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
