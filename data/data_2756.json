Do you think the curriculum could have been improved upon in any way? If so, how? Do you think subjects could have maybe been taught in a way that would be a bit more compatible with your learning style? Do you think you would have benefitted from special accommodations that would have allowed you to learn in a way more compatible with your own learning style while still being in a school environment? If so, what accommodations do you think you could have benefitted from?\nOr do you think your learning style was/is just completely incompatible with any kind of school environment?
