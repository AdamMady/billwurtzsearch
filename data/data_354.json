Then I got the idea to ask how often you think about stars, because I had a good feeling you would answer that one. I heard someone say that men who think about the Roman Empire a lot probably had a past life there. So maybe it's possible you had a past life on a distant planet. What do you think? I'm not 100% sold on the idea, but it's fun to think about past lives. I have this thought that consciouness, much like matter and energy, cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.
