My problem is that I am so new to both concepts that it takes me an incredibly long time just to figure out the notes let alone being able to play the notes as i read them. Then once i figure out the notes from the sheet music it falls under muscle memory and i end up getting technically better with playing the piano but not so great at reading while playing. Should I focus on one more than the other to start or should i keep trying to play as I'm reading?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
