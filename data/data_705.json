I felt a bit disappointed when I realized this because to me it feels very strangely powerful to think of that line as disconnected from the previous lines in a songy sort of way, only being connected to the daydream line by a shared word, and perhaps referring to the narrator doing the dreaming. This interpretation also turns the previous lines from a sentence to just some relevant imagery, which also feels more powerful to me.
