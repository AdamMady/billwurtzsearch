But I think maybe there might. Like, I turned on the mic and thought out loud it for 52 minutes and thinking of it being able to be as a standalone thing that's releasable. And I keep thinking but i think its maybe just a bit less tiring to do it without that extra minigame. Do you think that minigame should be the norm? that i should strive to be as entert\n aining/e\n fficient thoughtwise even when the mics off. Now if that were the case, wouldn't that make my aspiration to have every thought be content? Then how would I organize that, and when? I think maybe theres a benefit of only turning it on in certain times and be able to verbalize what has been inner dialogue only for a while, and that in itself can be an interesting display of words over time. \n<br>I'd like to invite you to be the first listener of the first outloud thought session.
