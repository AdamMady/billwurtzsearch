When I record I just play into a shit mic that plugs into my computer and I have this interface thing (don't even know what you'd call that type of device) where I can record guitar or keys straight into the computer. I just use the standard recording program that just came with my computer (audacity).. i dont do anything with effects any editing apart from just adjusting the volumes of each track. I love writing and recording music, but the sound quality is always crap. Doesn't really bother me now. But again, I feel like at some point I'm going to have to climb that mountain of learning that side of making music. And it scares me because I don't know where and how to start or when I should just bite the bullet and dive head first into this world.&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
