I have not yet listened to it, as I like to watch your content with the video before experiencing it through audio only. Is it intentional that you released it on Spotify first, or is this just an unfortunate side-effect of making sure the song rolls out on time on all platforms?</qco> </h3><br><br>"

A lot of times I'll feel anxious during the day and that's when I most want to make stuff, and I think of all these great ideas during times like class, but then afterward, when I actually have the opportunity to work, I'm so relieved and relaxed by the day being over that I can't call up the same emotions that I had during the day and therefore can't create anything genuine. Is this a problem you had to deal with at all, and if it was, is the solution to just wait until you're in a position where you make your own schedule, or is it something else? thanks</qco> </h3><br><br>"
