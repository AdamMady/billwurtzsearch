For instance, last night I went to a nice Belgian restaurant. It was rather elegant, with good-quality (if a bit overpriced) food, and a rather elderly clientele. However, they were playing EDM/rave music at full blast in there throughout the whole time we were there, and while it didn't seem to bother everyone else too much, it drove me nuts. I'm not a particular fan of that kind of music, but that's not what bothered me about it-what bothered me was that it didn't match the restaurant's atmosphere and ambiance at all. In fact, it seemed to be a continued disturbance to the atmosphere, and it stuck out like a sore thumb. It was too bad, because I liked the food, and the decoreverything else was enjoyable, except the music.\nDo things like this ever happen to you? Do you have any advice on how to deal with situations like this (assuming that it wouldn't really be feasible to change the music)?</qco> </h3>"
