What it seems like you are consistently doing is having three accents during the beat (\"AND it's GONna BE a\"), but when I listened more closely you aren't doing a triplet feel over the beat, but rather, depending on the words in each particular occurrence, a 3-3-2, 3-2-3, or 2-3-3 pattern of 32nd notes (which fits better with the 16th note rhythms in the instruments than a triplet would). My question is: are you intentionally writing the melody with 32nd note syncopation like that?</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or are you just thinking about doing 3 accents over the beat? Either way, I'm impressed. Either you're successfully performing a near-impossible rhythm that you've written, or you're naturally creating one by ear as you try to sing with the best feel you can.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
