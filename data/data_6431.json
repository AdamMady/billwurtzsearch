Why don't I learn it?\" I then proceeded to shed it on trumpet for a while, but it wasn't for another few months before I heard it on a Bill Evans playlist, recognized it, did some research and found out it was a well known standard. So yeah. You're the reason a young jazz player got another standard under his belt.</qco> </h3><a href=\"https://billwurtz.com/jazz.html\">more where that came from</a>"
