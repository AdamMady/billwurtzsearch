Facticity is the third person perspective that any other person can take. These facts include biological facts about height, weight, race, gender, skin color, eye color, etc. However, these facts also include social and economic, psychological and historical facts as well. Transcendence is the first person perspective of a human being. With transcendence, human beings can \"transcend\" their facticity and become something more than they are or seem to be. This \"something\" they can become is a result of that human beings individual choices or decisions, and many turn it in to a tug-a-war situation in life. People who want both 100% of transcendence and facticity basically want to be god is some sort, \"can do no wrong but has ultimate power\". So my question is what is your take on this, is there a possible balance you choose when it comes between the two?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
