Some mud may be necessary to be cut via EQing (if used in the wrong areas), but it seems like a valid production technique when trying to add some density while maintaining the harmonic colour, if you will. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, may add some stereo dimension when taking panning into account.
