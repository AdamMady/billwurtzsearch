Why excitement for a goal dwindles the closer you get to achieving it. I've noticed the struggle usually occurs when I hit some sort of road block. Almost always when the experience of *doing it* stops being fun. Instead of asking \"how can I push through it?\" I wanted to know what you do to make the process enjoyable again? When I try to coerce it into a desired outcome it only makes it worse. Sorta like it's protesting or arguing with me in some weird way. So how do you invite the play back into it and help things move more freely? Thanks.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
