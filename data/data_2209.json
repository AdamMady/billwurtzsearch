One thing I'm trying to do to get a better \"ear\" for music is to pick out little patterns and phrases and stuff that catches my attention. There's this one thing that I hear all the time... I heard that one Charlie Puth song, One Call Away, on the radio today. Towards the end of the song (starting at around 2:19 in the album version, not the music video) when he does like a stripped down, variation of the chorus he sings the line \"nothing on me\" and he adds this little twist that makes it sound different than the other choruses in the song. Like he adds some kind of extra chord or something. I'm drawing a blank on other specific songs I've heard something almost exactly like this, but I know it's something I hear very often in a lot of music, especially pop and R&amp;B type stuff. I can't seem to figure out exactly what's going on though, or what the little cho\n rd varia\n tion thing is. Can you maybe help me out on this?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>",
