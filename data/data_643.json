It also doesn't help that I only get to sing when the house is empty, which is maybe only twice a week. I also really want to play the piano ever since I messed around with it a few times in the past but I don't have access to it now and my parents are pretty discouraging when it comes to music because they think it's useless and will only distract me further and isn't profitable enough to bring food to the table, so I definitely can't convince them to buy one anytime soon, nor do I know a close friend who owns a piano (probably because I don't have many friends). I want to get involved with music but I'm currently studying engineering (which I'm also passionate about), which is extremely hard to handle as it \n is without bringing music into the picture. I think I spend a good chunk of my waking hours listening to music in the background, but I'm kind of reluctant to explore music theory not only because it's kind of inaccessible but also because once I dig too deep I just become entrenched in it and I don't want to become even more distracted from my studies. The education system in my country also holds this suffocating disdain for anything related to the arts and music, so there aren't many opportunities/resources that I know of. I'm still pretty optimistic about taking up music as a hobby, but the pressure and competition in academics will only increase in the next few years, making it even harder to give time to basically anything else I might be interested in. Anyway, complaining aside, I just need a few tips on how I could build on any crucial skills I might need for playing an instrument or singing because I've had zero training in anything related to music (due to the aforemention\n ed shitty education system). Also, sorry for making this unnecessarily long (I wanted to give the proper context for my situation).&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
