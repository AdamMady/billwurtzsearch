While a lot of them use a lot of color and interesting musical riffs, for some reason you unbox very little if anything in most of your vids. What I would love to see from you is a video where you 1. wear a go pro 2. film yourself taking something out of a box. Anyway, loving the content but you seriously need to think about entering the future of entertainment&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
