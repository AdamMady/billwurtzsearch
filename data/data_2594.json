I usually either don't hear myself or i don't hear the track while recording, and it's been tedious. Makes all my harmonies sound like parallel moving tritones. Also how do you personally write vocal harmonies? Do you just have them in your head and instantly record all parts on top of each other? This is a cry for help.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
