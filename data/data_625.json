The 3rd line (\"do you love me\") heightens again because it's the first mention of relational feelings to/from another person. Then the 4th line ('have things gone astray') heightens again because it suddenly indicates that the relationship has a history. so in 4 lines we've gone from meme/clickbait to a whole slew of longterm emotions/situations to deal with.
