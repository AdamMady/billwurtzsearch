Basically whenever I do anything, I feel like I have to understand it perfectly, and not just like perfectionism but like a need to see how it all works from scratch. Like I'm making a computer translator, and basically I need medium to reflect semantics. But then I get so stuck on how semantics works and I still haven't continued coding cause I'm trying to understand the underlyingness of how things work. Or like if I have to do math work, I think of the nature of numbers, how almost all operations are defined recursively in the end including addition and all, and I don't get anything done for a long time. (I'm not trying to call myself smart;&nbsp;I really am a lazy dumbass in the end) But in the end it's good though and not a complete waste of time, cause it feels like you get it all even if countless people have thought of the same stuff before you. And also in the end this is practic\n al in so\n me way, as actually understanding is like building foundations for a house rather than being quick to build some that that you're not sure how it stays up. Even if the people who build without foundations are more efficient really. So my guess is that as you do these 3D stuffs, you're trying to understand the stuff cause glossing over it or trusting other's people's things without understanding them just that just feels wrong. I hope I don't sound like a psychologist or something assigning a guess, I'm really just guessing a guess.</qco> </h3>"
