    "html": "<h3> <dco>9.20.18&nbsp; \n6:37 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Hey Bill, I've been reading through the past week or so of questions and answers and I have noticed a trend in how you answer questions, and I assume it is completely intentional and an extension of the persona that you display in your songs, which in itself is cool and honestly pretty damn endearing due to the sideways and sometimes really succinct and brief ways you answer most complex questions/comments that I or most other people would elaborate upon.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My guess for why you rarely elaborate on any answer you give (especially in regards to questions about you or your music) is because you either want people to figure it out for themselves or its just personal and (I assume) you don't want to divulge that information about yourself, both of which are respectable and genuine reasons. However as someone who just wants to know whats going on inside that brilliant brain of yours, it drives me absolutely insane! You so very clearly have ideas you want to \n convey a\n nd messages you want to communicate with everyone, and about 80% of these questions have genuine answers about motivation, attitude and inspiration, all of which are actually GREAT advice! If possible could you give an explanation of a lot of the motivation behind your songs?</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or at least in some way tell us a message or central idea you want your audience to take away from your music.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And don't worry, i'm not expecting a direct answer, both because you're not a very direct person in your responses most of the time, and more so because all great teachers of philosophy and introspective thought never just tell people what they are trying to get them to understand.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really really want a full response so I can understand your thought process. To be more clear, i'm not asking for a \"moral of the story\" message or anything like that, I'm asking more if there is a method of thought that you live by that leaks through in your songs? Because you have a very unique way of making song\n s that a\n lways seems to have deep and intertwining themes. If possible can you walk us through your philosophical approach to the world around you and your attitude towards trials in life as well as your way of expressing this through your music? \n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't worry, i'm already expecting on getting goofed on with a one word response, or getting a really backwards answer. I just figured that I might as well try and ask all this stuff. Because after all, where is the harm in asking.&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
