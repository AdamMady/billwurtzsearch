Like if you look at songs from the late 2000s early 2010s and compare them to songs from today it's really a surprise to find out that they're the same genre because they're really quite different. Then if you go further back to the 80s for example you see that they're really different from today's music. Now that I think about it this is the same as with other genres as well.
