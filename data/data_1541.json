But, here i was, suddenly doing most of my work in a different program which has the distinct advantage of being available on computers made later than 2014. so being aware of that, a spectacular cascade of events suddenly began to unfold, which i can possibly trace back to viewing a youtube rental of spiderman into the spider verse, for which the only way i could watch it was on a borrowed computer, because my main computer had finally become officially too old to play the movie with ANY browser. that realization, combined with seeing how much faster this borrowed computer was from mine (despite actually being the same age), combined with the outrageousness of the visual effects in that particular movie, combined with the previously mentioned reasons for being ready to make the transition, i decided to reach deep into the savings acount and see if i can make things a little more interesting ............\n<br><br>"
