My life has been feeling empty and directionless for a long time and I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. Then I discovered you and I just felt like wow that's exactly what I want to do. Be a musician, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist content creator etc etc. I'm not out of highschool yet and I'm very close to turning my life around but I don't know if it's stupid to pursue something only because of my adoration of you? I can't tell of it's following my dream or taking some obsession too far. Sorry for the long ueqstion</qco> </h3>"

The first part is incredibly somber and quite frankly depressing, exuding the feeling of exhaustion and trying to trick yourself into going forward (maybe this is just my personal experiences with depression and feeling desperate to keep moving, but the three lines about how far you've gone and then with the \" and it's a long long long long long way back\" to me feels more like a reminder that you can't change your mind now. Instead of being encouraging and motivating, to me it feels daunting and frightening that now you kind of have to keep going forward since you cant go back.) \n<br>\n<br>Regardless of the first bits, the second part se\n ems to t\n ake a more positive outlook, especially with the last line with the \"road\" being to success. My best guess is that this song is about struggling to stay either motivated with a project or with life in general, that or it could be about depression and a kind of subliminal encouragement to those suffering that it DOES get better if you keep fighting. Those are my two best guesses. What do you think I'm mighty wurtz?</qco> </h3>"
