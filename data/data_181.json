For example, occupational surnames seem to imply that you are your job, but they date back to the Middle Ages. Meanwhile, due to the Industrial Revolution making labor more efficient, people have more free time, and they get to have a \"work-life balance\" with \"hobbies\". Not everyone works on a farm because not everyone needs to work on a farm. People aren't separated into castes like lords, vassals, and peasants;&nbsp;they can change how much money they earn. Don't get me wrong;&nbsp;the poor get poorer and never any richer, and you are not the car you drive or the contents of your wallet and all that. But I think some clarity on the issue of capitalism is much needed. Thoughts?</qco> </h3>"
