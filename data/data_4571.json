Pretty much all the videos/tutorials for this kind of thing I've seen online are all just saying \"use this mode over this scale degree\" and/or \"highlight the chord tones.\" Which, yea, that works... But, I don't really like looking at playing music in this kind of way. Whenever I improvise/solo I try to base what I'm playing around the main melody (kind of like a 'theme and variation' type of thing). </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think when you're improvising, you shouldn't be thinking about scales and stuff, you should be thinking about the melody and harmony of the song.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, honestly, looking for work as a musician, being able to improvise off of a lead sheet is a good skill to have. I know there's a lot of gigs out there where you just kind of flip through the 'Real Book' and take turns comping/soloing over whatever song you happen to turn the page to. If somebody put a piece of sheet music in front of you that you've never hear\n d or pla\n yed before, how would you put together a solo that sounds good/interesting to you? Can you sight read the melody, but instead of playing the melody you're reading, come up with a variation of that melody on the spot as you're reading it for the first time? That seems really difficult.&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
