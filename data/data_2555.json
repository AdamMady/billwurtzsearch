Initially, I was planning on getting at least 5 chapters done before releasing the first one. Then releasing all proceeding chapters once every month. That way, readers know exactly when too check for the next chapter. But now, I really feel the need to release the first chapter and show it to the world, but I'm not even four pages into the second one. My question is, should I release the first chapter now or when I have others prepared?</font> </h3>"
