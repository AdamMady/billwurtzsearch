I was wondering if you had any advice on working on a project for a longer time without falling out of love with it?? For me personally, it feels like I can only make stuff in short bursts of motivation, like in one session, and it often so happens that those bursts don't even last long enough for me to happily finish the songs I started. This really sucks because sometimes it really feels like I'm not using my full potential. Any advice would be highly appreciated, and by the way thank you for everything you do</qco> </h3>"
