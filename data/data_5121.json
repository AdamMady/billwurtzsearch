    "html": "<h3> <dco>7.5.23&nbsp;\n4:18 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> there seems to be two opposing advices when it comes to creation and the \"big idea\". some suggest putting it on hold until you feel confident enough in your skill to tackle it without \"wasting\" the idea. But another seems to imply that other big ideas will keep coming so just focusing on it now is good. I feel like the first advice can end up making someone to never work on that one thing they really wanted to put out there for fear of never being ready. Since they could always improve more before tackling it. Maybe its just a matter of feeling ready? and maybe some people are adventurous enough to feel ready asap? maybe its not about being adventurous idk, im just kind of brainstorming and maybe projecting my own personal feelings towards this situation. Do you feel like writing a lot of songs makes you feel ready to tackle \"big ideas\" in other mediums/formats like storytelling? or do you feel its a different scenario enough to feel like you need to work yourself up to the more ambitious or attached-to ideas. One thing seems for sure though, if there is only one idea im passionate about, it feels obvious to tackle that one, but if more come it makes sense to hold off on the one i may be more-attached to or more ambitious about. I guess my \"bad\" feeligns towards the advice of holding until one feels ready is the assumption that it forces one to focus on things one is not passionate about. and it may come from a completely subjective situation of being REALLY passionate about one thing right now and the idea of forcing myself to focus on something else feeling like a dam would be placed in this current world building flow.</qco> </h3>"
