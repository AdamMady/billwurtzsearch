Right off the bat I was fascinated not only on how you function as an artist, but in your day-to-day life, your \"survival strategy\" if you will. And you even give a specific date on when you stared making videos non-stop save for a one-week break!\nAs an artist myself, this is very inspiring as I feel I've been stuck with a bunch of material written but not recorded. Like... what does one need to do to work on the level your doing? How do I engage this? Is it a personal event, or a simple yet sudden change of mind that causes this paradigm shift (if that's the proper term)?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
