I seem to periodically flit between complicated chords, interesting harmony and trying to write geoundbreaking crazy stuff and just simple diatonic stuff with powerful melodies, more focused on the emotional conveyance - squeezing as much emotion out of a simple idea as possible, rather than trying to convey something super-interesting and harmonically spicy. I have about 15 full tracks I want to record for some kind of release, but they're all so different - some are pretty wild and others are just 3 chord ABABCB style things.
