I know you say to write words together with music and I've always tried to do that, and I've even played around with that random word generator... but lyrics are like a giant fucking anchor tied to me. I can never come up with words that I'm happy with. So I have all these songs that are pretty much finished, but the vocal melody is just like humming or scat singing with some random phrases here and there thrown in. It's like the things I most want to express are the things that are hardest for me to put into words, and I've never been much for writing poetry and stories and stuff, which I know is a different ball game than lyric writing.. but still, I've never considered myself a 'writer'... writing words has just never been my strong suit creatively. I feel like if I could just get more\n comfort\nable with lyrics, then I could churn out songs like a machine. But I always second guess myself and I'm afraid I sound too cheesy or cliche or that people will laugh at me or make fun of me or whatever... Can you help?</qco> </h3>"
