Given this fact, it seems silly not to take advantage. But, the issue is, songs are supposed to be fun to listen to. At least I want my songs to be fun to listen to, that way people will want to listen to them while they work and such. But what if I want to write a song about something that is sad? Like, if I wanted to write a song about my dog dying (hypothetically), then the song would have to be slow and loud to match the terrible sadness of the death of my dog, right? But, would that song be fun to listen to? I wouldn't want to do the dishes while listening to a song that makes me feel like my dog died. So, my question is, how do I achieve a balance between lyrical and musical content while ensuring my music is enjoyable? Do I only write songs about things that are good? That seems awfully limiting. I look at th\n e songs that you make and the songs that other artists make about sad topics and those songs seem to sound happy while talking about things that are sad. Pink Floyd's Time, for example, talks about the stress of getting older and then it rips into a *sick* guitar solo. The thing is, it works really well, even though it doesn't really sound... sad? Like it sounds like how getting older feels, and even though getting older should feel sad, the solo doesn't feel sad, even though the solo sounds like how getting older feels. This appears to conflict with the transitive property. How do you do this?</qco> </h3>"

So, I'm a classically trained musician and started to play some Latin instruments. I decided to travel to another country to watch in person how my idols played. I didn't speak any Spanish, but it was super valuable to meet them in person. It took me two years to implement what I saw. I did sort of talk to them, and they did point out some stuff, but honestly not much. I did most of the analysis and implementation in my practice.
