I sang from the time I was 2 on my own, got lessons in college, and then taught voice for years. I'm wondering what your process was like. I feel like your tone is really good and you have consistent technique. I like modeling my vowels off of yours! \n<br>\n<br>When teaching yourself singing, did you ever research vocal technique, or is it moreso you just practiced until you found what felt good?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
