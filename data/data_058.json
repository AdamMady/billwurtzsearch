    "html": "<h3> <dco>4.25.25&nbsp; \n1:00 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco>\n  i get this thing where i feel \"right\" \"good\" \"different in a good way\" and often times the consequence of this is to try to capture it in a bottle for either others consumption or my own consumption in the future, when the feeling is gone. But I realize that often times that desire and process is external to the feeling, thus killing it in the process, and nothing left to capture. Do you find that music allows for this process to persist while hopefully capturing some of it in the process? Sometimes the right words come to express it, but whenever the goal is to express what it is, it feels like it leaves, it scares it away. its like a magnet thats attracting something by being, but as soon as it wants to attract something it faces it, and by that action gives it the opposite pole. I feellike maybe it is more important to let this feeling permeate more and moreand not worry about capturing it. and maybe later ill be so familiar with it that i can draw a map to it, instead of trying to capture it which seems futile.</qco> </h3>"
