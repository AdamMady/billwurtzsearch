There's just so much unique, complex genius that goes into them. Listening to the first few seconds of \"And the Day Goes On,\" for instance, the snare drum doesn't follow a rhythmic pattern (although it works beautifully), so I have to listen to it 2 seconds at a time to understand it (while isolating it in my mind from the other instruments, which is hard to do when I get mesmerized by the chords). There's also some subtle tambourine and a few short flute notes in there, that you have to listen closely to hear, and then a bunch of different instruments starting to pour in. It's incredible. I'm in awe. </qco></h3>"
