I don't know. it's kind of a strange feeling to deal with. maybe it's what makes me human. but it doesn't really feel like a lot of other people experience the same thing. maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. I don't know what I'm seeking out. maybe I'm seeking out general adventure and meaning and purpose. or maybe I'm seeking out other people up to the same thing. maybe all of those things and then some. I guess I don't have a problem with it. actually I kind of like it. but that doesn't make it any less bewildering.
