Me personally, I view albums as more like a book or a short story, where each track is a particularly memorable sentence from a chapter that sticks in your head, or a plot twist/intriguing moment or something like that. The whole purpose of an album in my opinion is to create a story that's bigger than just one song could provide, or rather tell one story but with a lot of nuance and detail to it. Instead of taking them on a short journey with one song and trying to pack as much as you can in there, with an album you can give yourself time to think and breathe and tell as much as needs telling and in the time it takes, y'know? Not tryna invalidate your approach to \"musical storytelling\", but that's the angle I tackle the music-making bull from, anyway.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
