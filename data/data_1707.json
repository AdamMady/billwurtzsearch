You could infer that from what he's saying but I don't think he's directly said anything about multiple layers of simulations. Sorry i'm a bit obsessive and just wanted to clear that up. Genuinely curious what you think about that though, honestly the whole concept seems a bit wacky to me but i like to entertain wacky ideas sometimes I guess. Hoping you responded to my follow up with the quotes though, also keep in mind this idea isn't very unique to him, Nick Bostom formally proposed the theory back in 2003 I think.&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
