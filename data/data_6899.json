I've had asthma since I was a kid, and other recurring respiratory issues.. so sometimes it's tough to hold out a note for a long time, or to sing a full phrase without having to stop to take a breath, I think it might limit my vocal range too. When I do try and sing, I sound like if&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald Fagen smoked way too many cigarettes and put a clothespin on his nose. I love music, and I like to think that I am pretty decent on the instruments I play, but so many songs are driven by the vocal parts. Like, I think really the function of instruments in a song is to compliment/accompany the vocals (which should usually be front and center)... Not really singing makes it tough for me to actually come up with vocal parts, so I try to over-compensate with the instruments when I write. But when I do play with a singer, usually there's too much going on with the in\nstrument\nal arrangements and it sounds too jumbled/cluttered. Any advice for me?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
