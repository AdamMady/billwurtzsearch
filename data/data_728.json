A neat hack i found was to improvise the lyrics. i always seemed to sound much better when the words were genuinely made up at the time i'm singing them, instead of scripted. and if they are scripted, you have to ask a lot of similar questions that an actor would ask, about your character and your situation that you are trying to envoke. but aside from that, i also found out later that simply the more time singing makes you better. then much later on, a voice doctor told me that clearing your throat is bad, so i stopped doing that, and i also picked up a boring warm up exercise which i do on morning walks\n<br><br>"
