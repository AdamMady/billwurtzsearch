Thank you and have a great day!</qco> </h3>      \n\na chord called \"G minor 7\", often written as \"Gmin7\", or \"G-7\", or \"Gmi7\", will most importantly include notes Bb and F, then less crucial but likely containing note D, and in the bass will be note G. the other chord you mentioned (with note B instead of Bb) will be known as 'G7'\n<br><br>"
