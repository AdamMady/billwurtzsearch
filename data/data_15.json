Now that I learned all major, minor and 7th chords in root position, everything I play as a roman numeral progression sounds so similar (and not very great since I don't know my inversions yet) I'm vaguely comfortable using diminished/augmented chords or some passing chords here and there and I'm familiar with raising the bass note a whole step up for a jazzy slash chord at the very end of a phrase... But other than a few things like that, my jazz vocabulary is pretty limited and I can't seem to figure out how you do all these complex key modulations. There has to be a better way than aimlessly watching a bunch of jazz music theory videos on YouTube, right? Should I grind out the inversions? Should I learn how to write in minor keys?
