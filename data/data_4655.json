Decided to focus solely on the score without quoting lines or singing along to jingles (the new arrivals one and the Turkey one almost got me).\nThe question: How did you get so skilled in matching sounds to visual actions? The sounds you pick for zooming, panning, an empire expanding, a picture getting smaller, even an arrow being drawn are so precise and perfect every time. Have you always just heard sounds accompanying non-auditory actions in your head?
