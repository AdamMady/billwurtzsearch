If you must do videos, do the ones that require as little editing as possible (i suggested before ones with just the song and the name on the screen or the rotating vinyl). Your fans on youtube will be satisfied, the ones who like songs will be as well, and of course you will get to organize your time better. I see it as a win-win situation at the moment. After you get more comfortable, you go back to more elaborate videos and updating the reality stuff etc. So for a while, focus \"solely\" on songs and like two weeks from now you start to do the \"easy\" videos so everyone is happy. Just a suggestion.  Have a good day. </qco> </h3><br><br>"

And I have been thinking... if you want to make new songs, you can use songs like, notbugs, and hide the money. You can even make more monday videos, including music videos like murder your demon and even blue boy, because I really want to see that. And I hope you do more of those reality stuff you posted, like the reality video where you said you posted the japan video. I am still waiting to see what is next for your future.
