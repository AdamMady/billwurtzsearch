What I'm talking about here is how before you're year long break, the harmonies mostly consisted of like I-IV-V chords such as in \"mount Saint Helens \" and \"when I get older\" as the main chords in the verse, although they both modulate to the flat 6 at some point but those are during bridges and don't relate to the verses which is what I'm on about here.<br>After said break the harmonies in the verses became more ambiguous, especially after \"I'm scared \" and in \"at the corner store\" where the whole of the verse is just a whole lotta Bsus4 . And in 987 where there's the maj7 slash chords and such. Might just be my imagination so point me out if I'm wrong.</qco></h3>"
