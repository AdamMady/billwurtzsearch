This is not the part i refer to as the writing. the writing process i am referring to is entirely before any piece of contruction matierial is touced. before any of the actual audio recording / video contents are actually created. i must know how the song/video goes, completely. every word, every melody note, and every important chord. and the exact tempo, and the exact sequence, and the exact road map all the way until the end. and therefore as a by product of that i therefore also know almost exactly how long it will play. This still leaves room for tremendous amounts of detail. All the details really. the writing process is getting everything EXCEPT the details. That's because when you are constructing the house, (or making the recording, or creating the video graphics), there are SO MANY things to take care of and worry about, just in terms of what materials you use, what details to put, besically that's when the paint actually hits. There are so many things to deal with and worry about there, i have found out that you CAN NOT be unsure of *how the song goes*\n<br><br>"
