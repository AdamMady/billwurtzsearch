At work in the amazon warehouse many ideas came to me. and I would run around like a crazy person trying to find a pen and paper to write them down. then at home after a while I ended up having a stack of these ideas. then two stacks and three. then I went for yoga teacher training and learned about aparigraha and wanted to become detached and the feeling I get when an idea comes feels very attached so I wanted to get rid of my stacks of ideas. so I got rid of most of them and kept a few. But now I'm thinking, why do I need to capture every idea? because I'm not the source of them. The source is endless! and if the source wanted me to have an idea at a certain point in time, it would send one, right? so maybe that's how I can remain detached while also being open to receiving ideas. But then again I have nothing to show for any of this yet, while you have much to show for your methods of capturi\n ng all possible ideas. So maybe I shouldn't have gotten rid of my stacks of ideas. Oh well. The past is the past.</qco> </h3><br><br>"

It's also is in 5/4 but I was half thinking in 4/4 and 3/4 when I wrote it, so now it's just this mess that doesn't properly fit into a key or time signature, which is making it very difficult to continue on it.
