In a 3D environment such as history of the world, this is done with video files. render the globe moving as you want, with the full map on it, then replace the globe map with a same sized map with only the desired territory, and the rest black. re-render the exact same sequence, with exactly the same start and end time. then import both videos into your 2D timeline, and stack them, and key out the black, as before\n\n<br><br>"
