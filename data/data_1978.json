I have a couple concerns, first is that I'm extremely scared of making any moves whatsoever, partly out of fear of rejection but also because I think she is way too perfect for me. Personally, I feel like an ugly sack of shit compared to her which is the opposite of encouragement. Do you have any advice for me? \n<br>\n<br>Thanks</qco> </h3>"
