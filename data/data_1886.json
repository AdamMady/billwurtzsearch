Not the songs themselves, but all the background music.. The music always seemed to follow Mr. Rogers' vocal delivery and timing and pauses so perfectly. Like, do you think they would they just tape the show without music and Costa would do his thing? Or do you think there had to some coordination for timing and stuff? I wanna try to do some \"spoken word\" stuff with music accompaniment, but not sure if it's better to just record the speaking naturally or to do the music first, or try to do both simultaneously, etc.. it just blows my mind how perfect the music was in that show. I've tried to do it but I can't get the timing and flow of the speaking and music to blend so nicely like Rogers and Costa.&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
