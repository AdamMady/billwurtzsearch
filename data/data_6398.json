I may have fear of letting go of the attachment to my ideas and wanting to make them so grand. Did you have any hard time transitioning from not having a schedule to having a schedule? Did you have to set yourself time limits or alarms to remember to do certain things and move on to the next? Has having the schedule made you not just more productive in general as a result of it, but gradually increased your capacity to be more productive over time of consistently adhering to it? \n<br></qco> </h3>"
