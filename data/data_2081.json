I know normality doesnt exist, but i think you might have some ideas about whats the \"normal\" way of expressing oneself (in which, to my standarts, you dont follow). Am I looking into it too much? Maybe you are \"joking around\" as people say. I think that what I tried to ask is: how would you define yourself from a more understandable (to other people in general) point of view?. man im sorry (since i dont even speak english), it feels impossible to communicate with the ambiguity of almost everything around us, and maybe your ambiguity called more my attentio\n n than o\n ther ambiguities (because its easier to notice). thank you for reading, i hope i made some sense&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
