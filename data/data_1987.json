One thing I've learned that is really important is that it's how the voice matches with the melody and words... like getting the most out of the style of your voice. Good example I can think of is donald fagen. I can't imagine him belting out freddie mercury tunes or something, but I think he's a great singer because his voice is perfect for his melodies/words. I guess I just need to find my 'character' in my voice?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
