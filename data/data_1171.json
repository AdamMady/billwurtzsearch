I don't want to master my track after finishing the mix. I want to do all at the same time. What compression and limiting settings do you recomend to use? This a real strugle for me, all the songs I love (including yours) have a very nice and balanced volume and mix. My music always sounds lower than the others when reaching -14 LUFS. Thank you so much</qco> </h3><br><br>"
