I am at a reasonably young age and I have a question and you seem to be very wise. If I have a passion and want to persue that passion as a job, I should. Right? What if that job is hard to aquire and I don't have very good skill sets? Do I still follow that passion knowing it will enivitably end with failure? Or do I choose another path? I know you don't really need to answer this question but it's 3am and that's when I really start to think about the unsertanty of my future. \n<br>\n<br>Yours sincerely \n<br>Idk why this is in the format of an email.&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"

My lessons teacher set goals for me to work toward that I have to have down by the time of a certain audition. I'm working really hard to meet them and improve, but I'm just not improving. My teacher told me to do a couple exercises on my instrument that she GUARANTEED would get me to my goals if I did them religiously but I've been doing them and I'm still not improving. I'm VERY worried I won't be ready by the time of the audition, which would be really embarrassing because a lot of people think I'm really really good even though I'm not. I really need some advice.
