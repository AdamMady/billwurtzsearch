I remember some places of that week, but aside from that I can't remember much. it's like at this point i miss remembering those things more than i miss those things, and it feels new and old at the same time? It's like I miss the idea of those memories more than the actual memories. in a sense it made me realize that i'll probably slowly start forgetting about today and closer days further in the future. Do you feel it too? Is art how you deal with that? </qco></h3>"
