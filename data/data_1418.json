    "html": "<h3> <dco>11.28.19&nbsp; \n3:43 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> You responded to a question about tuning systems a while back. The asker wanted to know if you'd ever tried tuning completely in just intonation. You said it's a noble endeavor, but ultimately it's impossible;&nbsp;you couldn't even get a full major scale out of the harmonic series, much less a working system of chromatic harmony.\n<br>\n<br>I've realized something which could go a long way towards solving this problem - I've even composed/arranged some nice music using this concept. (It is by no means my original idea, btw.)\n<br>\n<br>Your problem was that you tried to create a major scale (C major, if I recall) in which each scale degree was only tuned one way, regardless of its 'function'. For example, F would always be the same pitch, whether it was the 3rd of a D minor chord or the 7th of a G7 chord.\n<br>\n<br>The way I started thinking about just intonation tuning is this: all harmony diatonic to C major can be derived from the harmonic serie\n s of Bb \n (minus 4ข, because C, in this case, is defined as the 9th harmonic of Bb).\n<br>\n<br>In the C overtone series, we can get a very nice version of the C major triad (1st, 3rd, and 5th harmonics), the G major triad (3rd, 9th, and 15th harmonics), the E minor triad (3rd, 5th, and 15th harmonics), and the B diminished triad (15th, 9th, and 21st harmonics).\n<br>\n<br>In order to get the three remaining triads, you need to use some 'undertones' of C - notes for which C is an overtone. I thought about it like this - if we get C major and E minor triads from the C harmonic series - we can just transpose down a (harmonic) perfect fifth to get F major and A minor triads. Then we can transpose down another perfect fifth to get the D minor triad (3rd, 5th, and 15th harmonics of Bb).\n<br>\n<br>Since F-2ข and C are both overtones in the Bb-4ข harmonic series, and since each overtone has a harmonic series of its own (which is still part of the original harmonic series), we can say that a\n ll harmo\n ny diatonic to C major can come from the Bb-4ข overtone series and sound great.\n<br>\n<br>However, to sound good, notes need to be tuned differently depending on what member they are in a chord. For example, the D minor triad in C sounds great on its own when tuned as the 3rd, 5th, and 15th harmonics of Bb-4ข. But the D minor triad can also be found within a G9 chord. In this case, a different tuning will be way more consonant - as the 3rd, 7th, and 9th harmonics of G+2ข (which is the 3rd harmonic of C and the 27th harmonic of Bb-4ข). If I remember correctly, this is how you tried to tune a D minor triad a while back - it sounds consonant in the context of a G9 chord, but not in the normal context of a D minor chord.\n<br>\n<br>I realize this is not so practical for live keyboard or fretted instruments, but it's been great for retuning recorded music or composing in a DAW.\n<br>\n<br>Thoughts?</qco> </h3><a href=\"q.php?date=201706141538\">here</a><br><br>"
