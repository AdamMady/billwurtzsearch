They'll keep old videos online. I remember back before History of Japan you were kinda in a love-hate relationship with Vine because it allowed you to trim and really concentrate your content, but doing so was kinda addicting(?) in a way and it sorta stagnated you from making longer videos until you made the bold move to cut Vine off entirely during HoJ production. I'm sorry if this question seems to be spiraling out of control or maybe I'm just rambling, but I'm curious to understand why Vine was an appealing outlet for your content at the time and if you've \"grown out\" of it and don't mind the discontinuation too much or if you still have some fondness for that service.
