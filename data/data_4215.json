I've been trying to find my personality type for months now, and I still haven't quite found it yet.

I really have this need/desire to fit in one of the 16 personality types, but I just can't seem to truly relate to any of them (for example, I'm too dumb to be an INTP, not sporty/active enough to be an ISTP, way too lazy to be an ISTJ etc.)... Maybe I'm not meant to have a personality after all? Maybe there's a secret 17th personality type that I do not know of?\n<br>Do these 16 personality types even matter?
