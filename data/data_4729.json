He's riding on a train (on his way to prison) and he's hungry for food and women (he's not gonna see a woman again any time soon) 5. He talks about \"loving the shade of those license plates\" i.e. he's making license plates, a stereotypical prison job.\n\nMy theory is that he loved his daughter and went crazy before killing her and his nervous breakdown only got worse as he got sentenced to life in prison so he wrote this song to say what he wants to tell his dead daughter whom he loved dearly. As he's \"talking\" to his daughter, he feels the need as a father to protect her from the truth, and \"lies about details\" by saying he's \"actually going to connecticut\"\n\nAt first he tries to convince himself that it's all for the better and that he's happy, evidenced by how he says he hopes the train doesn't get derailed, and how \"the season is winter, and the sky is so blue\" but gradually comes back to reality and understands the severity of the situation, as line \"it's summer and the sky has turned grey and my dreams are sailing away\" indicates he has spent enough time in prison for the seasons to change. \n\nOn a scale of 100% to 100%, how close is my interpretation? \n</qco> </h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nP.s. I know you said you wrote the song after picking New Canaan as a random town to take the train and wrote the song on the way there. I just don't buy that such poetry would have such a straightforward explanation.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
