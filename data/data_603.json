What helps you balance that?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>      \nthe problem is usually thinking too hard. songwriting is obnoxiously shy if it thinks you are thinking at all. the songwriting will never appear if it thinks you're thinking about it. i don't know of a way around this. because i don't know how to actually stop thinking. all i can do is be patient and eventually i'll forget to think. then the answers flood in. then i get so excited i think about how exciting it is. then i'm fucked. and so the cycle continues\n<br><br>"
