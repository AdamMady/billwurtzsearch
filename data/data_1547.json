Whats a good way to get over the feeling of having to explain up until the point one is convinced the other has heard to instead be able to get over it and move on. It can even be when giving advice, that maybe the other person doesn't want to hear or is not receiving well, i find that the need to give the advice can be more harmful than the advice itself since it can make the other person feel like they have a bigger problem than they do, or feel like they have emotional homework now having had pointed stuff out. How to know when one wants the advice vs not wanting it. How to stop going in circles when gi\n ving adv\n ice and not being cued of the fact that they get it, i dont even know what im trying to ask anymore. Funnily enough whenever I get in my head and find a new problem or solution I feel like you might relate to it and have insight.
