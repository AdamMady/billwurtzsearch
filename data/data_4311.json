Teacher kept asking him to sing higher and he just sing louder hahaha, not sure if that was the face he made from frustrtion from the throat-ear disconnect, or from the confusion of his voice not sounding like the timbre of the piano so it being harder to try and imagine what that pitch would soung like in voice.. it was a nice transformaion to hear him sing later on, it was just something he never tried hard enough to break out of his knowledge/skill comfot zone. Do you have any tips for breaking as many walls as you can daily? Things we may never know we could learn unless we tried doing them. Do you think this is part of what it's all about, or it's a distraction from getting better in your field?&nbsp;&nbsp;would they all help you in your field somehow? \n sounds l\n ike a multi-armed bandit situation, i want a marshmellow now instead of 10 later</qco> </h3><br><br>"
