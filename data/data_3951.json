I find it amazing how you can break this stuff down so easily. I've been playing music pretty consistently for around 15 years and I still couldn't nail what was going on there, especially the A+7(#9). Any tips on how to get better at breaking stuff like this down?</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you literally rewind, listen, rewind, listen, until you've heard every note you think you can hear?</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or does your perfect pitch give you the means to pick it apart super quickly?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
