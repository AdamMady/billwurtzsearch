So, I have a seemingly endless supply of unfinished songs. Some of them are just little bits and pieces,&nbsp;&nbsp;some of them are nearly finished. But I can probably count on one hand the number of songs that I actually finished and recorded this year. I want to finish my songs. I want a nice base of full, completed, solid recordings. But I LOVE to write, much more than record. The ideas come faster than I can keep up with. I have multiple binders filled with sketched out charts and I don't how many rough audio demos. </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At what point do I need to say, ok stop writing, and finish what you've got? The issue is if I finish what I got that would mean going a very long time without writing, which is my favorite thing to do. I know it's different for me than you, because I don't have a fanbase awaiting my next move and deman\nding mor\ne content... But I know this is something you've had to deal with. </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure you've been asked this a lot too.
