Don't misunderstand me, I LOVE your videos and I think they've gotten crazier over time, with all the 3D stuff, and movement, and detailed backgrounds, and wild colors etc. But doing simple, more minimalistic videos would let you do more songs at a faster rate, but still have a video to put up for your big youtube audience. Maybe find a balance between doing some wild and crazy videos and doing some videos with that more minimal style (like dont wanna go to school, free to do whatever, jodie foster, diamond, etc.)?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
