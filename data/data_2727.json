I've been living very minimally and am learning about and working on some very specific things at an insane rate. Never would have thought I would be where I am. But... I've not been creating or performing music with myself or other people. The new thing has taken over the obsessive and creative energy part of me. The extent of the physical practicing I do is playing with drum sticks on the floor sometimes (but like maybe a few times a month). This would sound insane to the me from a few years ago. Maybe I care about the new thing more? I'm not sure. It's very technicalresearchy work, and I work on well defined problems and explain them with precise language and equations as well as more ill defined engineering problems with pragmatism. I care deeply about these things (mainly a sort of NEEDING to find some truth or answer), but they never seem to invoke feelingsthat truly match my experience of music. The only times I get that feelingof awe and verge of tears thing is when listening to a song. Usually it quickly fades though and the mind is back racing around trying to work on my research. Do you relate to any of these kinds of things? I don't know if this phase is one part of making my future creations better or if I'm in a trap. To be clear, I view the things I'm working on now as an example of those creations, but they feel less real somehow. I'm making the assumption that there are some similarities to working in \"all the departments\" for your productions or getting really nerdy about whatever you do.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
