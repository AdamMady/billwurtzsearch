Also it may be different if your main instrument is a lead instrument - in that case you might want to know how to read melodies. And in general, i would recommend learning rhythmic notation, because often you will see rhythmic figures written in charts, and also it will be a very valuable tool when talking about the material with other musicians, you can refer to different rhythmic figures. and it would also help to know the names of the notes\n<br><br>"
