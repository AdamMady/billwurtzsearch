Firstly, I was wondering how you start writing a song.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t For me, I've just hit a few piano notes at random until I heard a little melody that I liked just by coincidence and that's where I start,</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t but it sort of feels like I'm cheating because I imagine real musicians put a lot more thought into their music. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\tMy other question is: do you think it's okay for songs to be short. I've never made anything longer than a minute. Maybe this was a weird question, I dunno. Thanks though.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
