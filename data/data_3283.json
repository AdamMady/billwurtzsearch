I think I slowly shifted my focus to other (often more useless) things and I've become more and more hopelessly overwhelmed at the thought of returning to music. I know baby steps and setting little goals can help, but I get overwhelmed even thinking about those. Do you have any tips on how to get over this?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
