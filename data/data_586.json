I have made tons of attempted songs, and there are people who say that they enjoy listening to them, but I still personally struggle with the idea that nothing I make is good. The little details like the tone of my voice, uneven piano playing, and overall quality issues suppress my music making constantly. People say that I shouldn't worry about it and that I am a perfectionist, but I don't feel like I can release or share anything I make the the world without knowing personally that it is of a proper level of quality, and none of the songs I have made have reached that insurmountable goal I've set myself. My question is, what should I do? Is there something else I can try to improve my opinion of my music, or should I just keep trying to make something that I think is good, and that I know I will never make.</qco> </h3>"
