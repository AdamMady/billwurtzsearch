And for certain little sections in certain songs, I want to figure out a way to intertwine the rhythms of the 2 guitars in a way where it sounds like just 1 guitar, but with like a delay/echo type thing. Do you think if I play the same part the other guitarists plays, but slide the whole phrase forward like a 16th note (or maybe an 8th note?) that would kind of give it that delay/echo type sound? I don't have any recording equipment at home to experiment with.. but do you think this technique would work? Any tips or advice on how to make it sound extra crisp and natural?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
