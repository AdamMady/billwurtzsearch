No single one is ruining my life (maybe alcohol and weed a little), but the main thing is that I want to be free and natural. \n<br>\n<br>Apart from weaning myself off caffeine, I plan to give them all up cold turkey at the same time for 30 days (except for Takeaway food if I am stuck some day). I can't find anything of anyone else doing similar. Do you think it's a bad idea to give up so much so quick?

There was also another switch labeled \"automatic/manual\" that probably had to do with a handheld button similar to the ones you see on Jeopardy! that would have allowed me to control the lights. The button was connected with a 1/4-inch plug like on serious headphones audiophiles buy for thousands of dollars. That was so neat!
