What if that job is hard to aquire and I don't have very good skill sets? Do I still follow that passion knowing it will enivitably end with failure? Or do I choose another path? I know you don't really need to answer this question but it's 3am and that's when I really start to think about the unsertanty of my future. \n<br>\n<br>Yours sincerely \n<br>Idk why this is in the format of an email.&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"

I'm VERY worried I won't be ready by the time of the audition, which would be really embarrassing because a lot of people think I'm really really good even though I'm not. I really need some advice.
