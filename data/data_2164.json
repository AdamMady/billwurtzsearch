If your art has this effect on me, I wonder what effect the other media I consume has on my mental and emotional equilibrium. I want to use this realization as an excuse to control my mental faculties and inputs, while I also try to remind myself that if I fall too deep down that hole I will miss out on some really cool/interesting shit.
