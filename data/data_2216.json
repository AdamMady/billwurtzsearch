Some pretty cool stuff. In You Really Got Me, Ray Davies apparently used a razor blade to splice the speaker cone in his amp and poked pins into the cone. In Street Fighting Man, Keith Richards got an electric-guitar sound from an acoustic by using a tape cassette to record and overdub the parts and by playing right up to the mic. Link Wray used to poke holes in his speaker cone with pencils to get that fuzzy tone. You had all sorts of experimentation with reel to reel tape recorders to get echos and other weird effects. Lots of old blues guitarists would turn the gain and volume all the way up on lo-fi amps to the point of nearly blowing out the speakers to get their sounds. Sam Phillips (who produced a lot of those 50's rockabilly/rock 'n' roll records with Sun Records) would re-feed the playback from the recorder to the head, adjusti\n ng the s\n pace between the heads, tape speed and other stuff to make crazy echo and delay effects.... Today with all sorts of effects pedals, built in effects on amplifiers, digital recording sofwares where you can alter the sounds in so many different ways, do you think that these \"proto-effects\" or these old recording techniques are obsolete? </qco></h3>      sure, but there are new techniques. or you can use old techniques too if you want. maybe even use future techniques<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you're recording do you ever experiment with any of this type of stuff to create effects or different sounds, or do you it all on the computer, effects pedals, etc.?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>      those techniques you mentioned never really made sense for me because i grew up in the digital age. but there are plenty of interesting rebellious \"wrong\" practices you can do in the digital age, or in any age. for example in the video \"Are you the Real You\" i decided to not actually crop out the screen fully on some of those text items, so some of the computer menus and window edges can actually be seen in the video. it was originally a mistake, but it adds character so i left it in. another crazy technique someone showed me many years ago was to open a picture in a text program (it looks like nonsense text) and start changing the letters. the picture glitches out in weird ways. i've never actually used that but that's another example of ways you can have fun in the post digital age\n\n<br><br>"
