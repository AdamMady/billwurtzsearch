Gosh so many questions and words to say, hopefully I can express them to you in a reasonable manner lol.\n<br>I want to be like you, I want to make music and I want to make people happy and entertained like you but I don't know where to start. I just started my life and it feels like I still don't have enough time. I love playing the ukulele, guitar, tenor guitar, and piano (I want to pick up the bass and drums too lmao) but I am really bad at most of them and I don't feel as if I can master them quick enough, and I feel like it'd be too late for me to get lessons on them. As well as I have loads of recording of songs that I have started but I don't know what to do with them, I don't have any type of recording or editing software, and I don't even know what type to get. It feels like I'm just stuck in this hole of, \"I want to do it, but I don't have the\n  means t\n o do it. \" And I really want to try to make music for a living. I really hope this hasn't gotten too confusing, but I want to be a successful musician, like you, but I don't know where to start or what to do, and you're one of the only famous people who like actually responds to, pretty much, all of their fans. Do you have any tips on what I should do, or where I should start or anything? P. S. Sorry for making you read this long lol&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
