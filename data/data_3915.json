    "html": "<h3> <dco>8.11.19&nbsp; \n3:45 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> often times when explaining myself i feel like either people dont get what im saying or dont want to hear it, but that just makes me want to explain it further, entering a feedback loop of me wanting to make sure they understand, and them really not wanting to listen or thinking they got it already while I think maybe theres a deeper way to get it. Whats a good way to get over the feeling of having to explain up until the point one is convinced the other has heard to instead be able to get over it and move on. It can even be when giving advice, that maybe the other person doesn't want to hear or is not receiving well, i find that the need to give the advice can be more harmful than the advice itself since it can make the other person feel like they have a bigger problem than they do, or feel like they have emotional homework now having had pointed stuff out. How to know when one wants the advice vs not wanting it. How to stop going in circles when gi\n ving adv\n ice and not being cued of the fact that they get it, i dont even know what im trying to ask anymore. Funnily enough whenever I get in my head and find a new problem or solution I feel like you might relate to it and have insight.

Fm6 wants to resolve to C, G7 and G7b9 want to resolve to C, or to Cm, or if you get sneaky they might go to Am or A, or even F# in some cases. and you look at the common notes here: D, F, Ab, B like to go to chords with their root on C, Eb, F#, A. and a lot of things can be explained by this pattern of minor third series.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t so i thought about your answer and how maybe it could fill some holes in my theory, like how Gsus4 likes to go to G, or how Eaug7 likes to go to E7 before it goes to Am, but ultimately i do not understand why what you said would be true. i know it was a long t\n ime ago \n but if you could explain why you might have said that i would appreciate the closure</qco> </h3><br><br>"
