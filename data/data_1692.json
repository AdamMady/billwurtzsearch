In that case you would be like a movie director directing the editor. But also the master because any editor you hire would have to go through an apprenticeship to understand your methods. Also, it would finally be a good time for you to update your software because the editor would be using the new software so he would teach you about it while you tutor him on your process. But I guess you'd certainly need more money to be abel to also pay the editor. All in all it could be cool.

(https://youtu.be/GC6nSX67Q-4?t=31 i linked to the relevant part at 31 sec). Listen to the guitar melody, it has these notes in it, ignoring all the little thrills and slides, - F# B A C#. And then the second guitar comes in and harmonizes over the first and I figured out that the harmony is a minor third (correct me if im wrong). But here's the confusion: the notes in the harmony are A D C# E, and A D E are all a minor third of the corresponding notes in guitar 1 - F# B C#. BUT the C# in guitar 2 is a MAJOR THIRD away from the A in guitar 1. And it sounds bloody cool. What's going on here, why isn't that C# a C, and why does changing that one note make it sound so much better?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>",
