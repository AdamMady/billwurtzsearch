I find myself straining as though I could correct the pitch with my thoughts alone -- much in the same way I might lean to one side to try to influence an errant bowling ball after it has left my hand.\n\nDo you ever get this feeling?  If so, does it only occur for you when the tone is out of tune relative to the musical context?  Or, having perfect pitch, does it also happen for you if the music is in tune with itself, but not with the traditional a440 tuning?</font> </h3>"
