But, you have so many huge fans (like millions of people probably) of the stuff you make, and judging by this question page, so many artists/musicians/writers who view you as a major influence and inspiration (myself included). So, I am confused why you think that people don't relate to what you're doing, or that people wouldn't love to go on your journey with you.&nbsp;</qco> </h3>      keep in mind, when i was in 3rd grade, most people didn't know what i was capable of, or what i would be capable of in the future. and even when the product finally comes out (which is like decades of hard work later), sure they may enjoy the product, but that has no bearing on whether they relate to the lifestyle it takes to create it. now it's a whole different story, because now there are a lot of people that want to collaborate with me for publicity\n<br><br>"
