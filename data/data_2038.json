I tried your suggestion and randomizing the hits/rests with the triplets has been super helpful. I also have this app on my phone that's like a metronome but you can plug in the specific rhythm notation, so I've been doing that to check to make sure my timing is good. Couple more questions about this whole thing. Are triplets almost always going going to be grouped in 3's?&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe its not really common cause I'm not seeing it in any of my sheet music, but would you ever see something like one eighth note/rest triplet just by itself immediately followed by a 'regular', non-triplet note/rest?</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And will triplets almost always start right at the top of the beat, like would you ever see 3 quarter note triplets, but starting on the \"and\" of the beat? How would you count out stuff where you kind of have to subdivide a single beat into 3's as well as into\n 2's or 4\n 's for regular eighth or sixteenth notes? (sorry if this is all jumbled, I hope you understand what I mean though).</qco> </h3><br><quotequestion><quotedco>embedded answer: <a href=\"https://billwurtz.com/questions/q.php?date=201801291407\">https://billwurtz.com/questions/q.php?date=201801291407</a></quotedco><br><quoteaco><h3><dco>1.29.18&nbsp;\n2:07 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Can you maybe lend a hand with this? I can sight read rhythms fine when it's just combinations of whole/half/quarter/8ths/16th notes (with rests or dots or ties or whatever)... But I get thrown off whenever triplets (or some kind of tuplet) comes in to play. I can clap out quarter note triplets or eighth note triplets over a click, but when it comes in the middle of a measure, or on an offbeat, or if there's only just one or two (instead of 3) of the triplets or if you have the triplets tied together with other notes, or a quarter note triplet paired with an eighth note triplet... all that kind of stuff just throws me off. I guess I kind of internalized the triplets in groups of 3 (three 8th note or 3 quarter note triplets in a line starting on the downbeat) and when they don't fall like that, I just can't feel the rhythm. Do you have any tips for how to count this stuff, or better yet just like how to internalize the feel of the notes to make them c\n ome more\n  easy and natural? Ideally, I just want to get to the point where I can just feel it and play it naturally and don't have to be counting continuously in my head when trying to read. Just like when playing for fun, or making my own music I'm feeling the pulses of the bar, but I'm not counting all the subdivisions just letting the rhythms come naturally.

I tried your suggestion and randomizing the hits/rests with the triplets has been super helpful. I also have this app on my phone that's like a metronome but you can plug in the specific rhythm notation, so I've been doing that to check to make sure my timing is good. Couple more questions about this whole thing. Are triplets almost always going going to be grouped in 3's?&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe its not really common cause I'm not seeing it in any of my sheet music, but would you ever see something like one eighth note/rest triplet just by itself immediately followed by a 'regular', non-triplet note/rest?</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And will triplets almost always start right at the top of the beat, like would you ever see 3 quarter note triplets, but starting on the \"and\" of the beat? How would you count out stuff where you kind of have to subdivide a single beat into 3's as well as into\n 2's or 4\n 's for regular eighth or sixteenth notes? (sorry if this is all jumbled, I hope you understand what I mean though).</qco> </h3>",

I can sight read rhythms fine when it's just combinations of whole/half/quarter/8ths/16th notes (with rests or dots or ties or whatever)... But I get thrown off whenever triplets (or some kind of tuplet) comes in to play. I can clap out quarter note triplets or eighth note triplets over a click, but when it comes in the middle of a measure, or on an offbeat, or if there's only just one or two (instead of 3) of the triplets or if you have the triplets tied together with other notes, or a quarter note triplet paired with an eighth note triplet... all that kind of stuff just throws me off. I guess I kind of internalized the triplets in groups of 3 (three 8th note or 3 quarter note triplets in a line starting on the downbeat) and when they don't fall like that, I just can't feel the rhythm. Do you have any tips for how to count this stuff, or better yet just like how to internalize the feel of the notes to make them c\n ome more\n  easy and natural?
