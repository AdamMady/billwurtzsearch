I think it's because I don't have a bench/stool (I usually just sit on my amp or something) so I'm holding my arms at a weird angle. But I'ma go get a stool to see if it helps. Any tips on like how high the stool should be (like how high should the keyboard be relative to my body) and how far away should i put the stool (like half an arms length or something)? Or is it more just whatever feels right? Couldn't find much online about this, besides how to hold/position your hands, but I know that stuff.&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
