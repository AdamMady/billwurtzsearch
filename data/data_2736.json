I loved programming and art, and I made little games or websites about things I liked. I think I internalized the praise of the people around me and started making things to impress other people instead of making things to enjoy myself. I stopped putting things in my work that represented me, because I was worried that critique of the work would feel like critique of me. I would work harder on things that impressed from a technical standpoint instead of something that spoke from my heart. I strived for 'perfection,' and as a result, my 'tech art' has become significantly more 'tech' than 'art'. I feel like I can no longer express myself. Any creative thing I can think of doing reminds me of all the stuff I did when I was in middle school, and I shudder at those memories which I have now deemed 'cringe.' I feel like the most important part of my artist brain has frozen over, and I'm worried I'll never be able to thaw it.\nHelp???</qco> </h3><br><br>"
