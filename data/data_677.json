Everyday I h\n ear more sarcastic comments about how everything I do is flawed and I'm never enough and I just don't want to keep doing this, taking everything they say to me. And I genuinely can't see this going on for more 5 years or so, till I finish college and get a job, without me completely falling apart. I just don't know how long I'll be able to hold on.
