This is what I was getting at (more fleshed out). The dom9 chord (e.g. G9: G-B-D-F-A) is probably the most consonant</qco></h3>      consonant? not sure what that means here<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; combination of 5 notes that we have in the 12-note scale. In lots of compositions, chords are more frequently thought of in 4 voices instead of 5 (thank u bach chorales), so we frequently encounter chords that are 4 out of the 5 notes of a dominant 9 chord. Using the G chord, we have G7 = G9 no9, Gadd9 = G9 no7, Dm6 = B hdim7 = G9 no1, and I sometimes also see G9 approximated in 4 voices by leaving out the 5th. These four are all pretty common chords, all quite consonant. But the 5th 4-pitch chord coming from the dom9 that should be just as consonant as the other 4 is G9 no3 = {D,F,G,A} = d minor add4.</qco></h3>      i'd call it Dmin over G, which is rampantly common, especially in the 1970s 'funk' sort of things. it can be used in the place of G9 or Gmin9. you wouldn't have to specify. james brown songs use these all day. i use them all the time<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The frequency I see minor add4 chords in leadsheets and such is basically zero compared to the other 4 chords that are dom9 chords omitting 1 of the 5 notes.</qco></h3>      if you put the bass on G, which i think is where it's supposed to be according to your study, i think you will find it much more commonly. or actually perhaps the lead sheet will just say G9 or Gmin9 but in reality the execution will leave out the 3rd<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you feel there is a good reason for this?</qco></h3>      this study is not really taking account for where the bass is<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the the minor add4 chord lacking something musically that makes it rare compared to the other chords mentioned, even though it should \"\"theoretically\"\" sound just as reasonable?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>      i'm not following why it 'should theoretically' sound just as reasonable, but if you feel it has been under-used, you now have an opportunity to find and demonstrate its goodness. if you find that it really is not so good, then it is only you who can explain why you don't like it\n<br><br>"
