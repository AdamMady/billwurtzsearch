But, like, I don't ~know~ if I really want to do it. And in order to start playing the guitar I would have to, like, acquire a guitar. And that wouldn't be a problem, but maybe I'll decide I don't want to do it after all, and then I'll have, like, a guitar. Should I take that sort of risk? I just want a way to be certain of whether I want to get into the guitar, without actually having to, like, do it. As you're a person who probably understands what it's like for people to get into playing music, do you have any advice?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
