There are some problems with this system-- one problem is that in some countries the notes are not named like this (quarter, eigth, etc). And the other problem is that when the top number is a multiple of 3 and the bottom note is 8, it's usually not actually the 8th note that gets one beat, it's usually actually 3 eighth notes that get one beat. but at least the bar length will adhere correctly to the number system, so for example what i'm trying to say is, 6/8 in the real world usually does not actually mean 6 beats per bar with the 8th note getting one beat. instead it usually actually means there's 2 beats per bar and the dotted quarter note gets one beat. this is mathematically equivalent, but felt differently, for speed. but let's face it, who really wants to write 2/2.667\n<br><br>"
