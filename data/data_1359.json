Over 14 million acres have been burnt. That's twice the size of Belgium. It's scary and hard to comprehend.\n<br>I'm lucky enough not to be affected but I feel dreadful not being able to help. I've managed to donate $130 dollars but it feels like nothing. It wouldnt even scratch the surface. It might put fuel in 2 cars with small tanks. It can't buy even a cheap firefighting pump, or hardly any livestock feed, or other necessities like that. It brings me to tears knowing I'm capable of so little because of my lack of money. Sometimes I wish I were rich, purely for the ability to fucking help more and make an actual difference. \n<br>Sorry, I just had to vent a bit. I can't express these feelings to people around me because ffs, these selfish issues are nothing compared with w\n hat the \n people affected are dealing with and it's childish of me to think like this.
