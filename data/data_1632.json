THEY ASK FOR THE MANUALS BACK. nobody told me that would happen and the manuals have always been ours to keep at every other certification i've ever attended. so it's like, do i return this and never train with the first aid company again (i have very distinctive handwriting that matches the handwriting on my registration form), or covertly try to steal the manual? i tried the\n  latter \n but a classmate saw and gave me a dirty look so i ended up returning it and shoving it into the middle of the pile. i still don't know whether that was the correct decision.\n<br>\n<br>my worst fear is that the next person reading that manual won't realize the anagrams are in fact anagrams, and will just think i wrote \"boner juice slut, join me and sin\" over the chapter title for no reason. anyway what would the best course of action have been? do you have any advice for future similar instances of this? thanks</qco> </h3><br><br>"
