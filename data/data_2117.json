Like, try to detach yourself from the recording for a minute and just listen to it as if it's not a song you've written, but something that you're hearing for the 1st time on the radio or something like that? Just to kind of clear your thoughts or get a fresh view? \n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I run into this problem when recording that after meticulously doing take after take after take to get everything just right, the passion for the song starts to dwindle from that initial spark of the idea. Not that I don't love the process of fleshing out the ideas, but after working on it for a while I guess it's maybe natural that you'd start to get sick of it (like how you say that you haven't actually watched hoj or hotewig after posting them)?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
