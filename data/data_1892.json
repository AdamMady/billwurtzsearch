It's like I forget how awesome the ideas felt to me when I came up with them. I've tried your strategy of just cateloging and recording every damn thing I think of, but I never end up going back to listen to them, and meanwhile I'm neck deepin something else that caught my attention, whether it's figuring out how the fuck math works, how the fuck computers work, how the fuck communication (e.g. talking politely, teaching) works, and also how the fuck the world works. </qco></h3>      you are going through the exact same thing i went through for many years<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   realize of bad habits to have, this is definitely not the worst I could have. But it's just so fucking annoying when you are going to bed at 2 in the morning to wake up for school at 6:30 and you feel like you\n've done\n nothing of substance, big and meaningful. Like I could be doing so much more, making the world just a little more cooler (I'd like to think), but just controlling the urge to swim deeper into the ocean even though you just dragged yourself out of the deep end is hard somehow. I can't shift from thinking \"But what? But why?\" to \"time to make shit.\"\n<br>\n<br>And really? I'm realizing that I'm okay with myself still humming a long, looking at and thinking about interesting stuff, because at the end of the day it is fun. But how exactly can I keep this up forever?&nbsp;&nbsp;This is fun, but I've kind of had the same kind of fun for a while now. Can I please just switch? </qco></h3>      you will switch gradually, as your desire to switch continues to grow to firey new heights <h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I'm honestly kind of just insecure, because now I'm just thinking, do I even know what I'm saying right now? Is it really that big of a deal? Even when my thoughts are trying to say otherwise. There is a disconnect here between feelings and thought, and I'm not sure what is going on. And no, those were not th\ne good w\nords to use there...that's not quite what I meant to say... I'm not sure if it's just sleep dep. making everything wobbly and unfocused, or my brain purposely trying not to think about this.\n<br>\n<br>I hate the feeling when I see both people that I follow online and people around me actually doing things, </qco></h3>      this is first hand proof that you are hard wired for success, beyond a shadow of a doubt. your ambitions are through the roof, and your standards are on the ceiling. and you think about it morning day and night, and in between<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  nd when other people around me are like \"dude just be lazy and stop caring so much\" IF I CARE SO MUCH WHY AM I GOING TO BED AT 3 JUST TO FINISH A GOD DAMN SCHOOL ASSIGNMENT well, let me take that back.

(There's a circle here somewhere...) Oh, and writing college essays. The sad thing is, there is more than enough time to do all this stuff, and more time to do more, during the summer. I know this. Everything would be great if I actually worked on it, instead I'm not. And I know the answer to this is that I'm on the right track, or that there is a tipping point. It's just so frustrating, and scary, because I don't know if I want to see myself if I ever go past that tipping point.\n<br>\n<br>I don't want to be boxed into everything. But I'm kind of wondering if I do need some sort of box to be able to continuously work on stuff.</qco></h3>      i think you will find that the box is just going to be your name. you. i know it's tempting to live a thousand parallel creator's lives, but there's barely enough time to live 1. so i think an umbrella strategy might ultimately work best for you here. as soon as you get fully comfortable with the fact that you are mr. do-it-all, you can start treating yourself like a king and just plan the task sequence from there. <h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I can't think of really a whole project to finish in a day, like your schedule when you were starting.</qco></h3>      that is why it is so vitally important to start very very short, small, and simple. there is a whole host of things that are learned AFTER you get your feet on the ground and doing things, that you never could have learned before. to sum it up into 2 points, first you will learn how far away actual real creations are from the vivid splendor you have imagined. but close on the heels of that is point 2 which is realizing how insanely much CAN be done, even just using the simplest tools available to you. learning happens fast from project to project, and the good news is, all your interests will find their way onto the menu. as long as you keep the train moving, you will surely hit all the stops and more. did i mention start small, trains are heavy<h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \nSorry, this kinda like turned into many different issues. I can't even lay a finger on a specific problem I'm having. Hate to bother you with this, but it's jus\nt a big \nfrustration for me that I haven't changed. Well, that's not true, I have changed a little, I'm looking at *literal* trash less often...\n<br>\n<br>Even if you don't reply, thanks for being an outlet for my thoughts. Sorry for this huge mess of a ramble, I'm also very tired, as I'm sure you are too.\n<br>\n<br>-IronLotus</qco> </h3>      \n<br><br>"
