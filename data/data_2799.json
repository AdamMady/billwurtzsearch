    "html": "<h3> <dco>3.21.23&nbsp; \n10:28 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> here is a quandry: when i make art i usually will either make a still piece or music. recently i have been really wanting to combine the two and even make ANIMATIONS. So, i did. over spring break i spent the vast majority of my time on an animation and, (dutifully keeping track of the time using proven timekeeping methods) and i worked 27.59 hours to make a minute and a half little music video. this is obviously not sustainable when i have to deal with the rest of my life such as school and work (which i still had to deal with over spring break). and now, im trapped in a loop of indecision. i so desperately want to make still art and i can usually finish a piece in 5-6 hours or so which is extremely doable. yet, i also DESPERATELY SO BADLY want to make music, which if im making an instrumental will probably take me 15-20 hours and if im making something with vocals (dont even get me fucking started) it will probably take me 19 BILLION hours to do, not even on top of the fact that i would want some visuals to couple with either and that would take 15 more hours and, if i commit to something, i will have a final project like 2 months later because i have to work and go to school if i want to survive. anyways, sorry for rambling. i guess what im asking is, how can i make myself commit to something that feels fufilling, even if i know im just setting myself up to get trapped in the never ending project. sorry i hope that makes sense.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
