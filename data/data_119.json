However, when I try to put it on paper, nothing comes out, which is weird because I can perfectly hear every detail of the music in my head but actually notating it gives me difficulty. </qco></h3>      probably the majority of musicians nowadays go straight to sound, without having any intermediary silent paper stage. the silent paper thing can be fun, but it's a specific thrill that does not need to be the default way, and probably is only possible if you have sufficient experiencing making audible music <h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is likely more common than I think, but that's not the main point I want to make.
