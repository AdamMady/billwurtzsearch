(feb 13 - mar 13) (i knew better than to ask for 2, that was just too insane.) i tried as hard as i could, and i didn't make it. once you hit an original proposed deadline and it's not done, it can be very devastating. much to my dismay, it took until april 25th to get it done, for a total of 11 weeks. during this time i should mention i felt i had very much to learn about audio mixing, and was determined to get better sounding mixes, so i was spending several days in the mix, also weeks in the arrangement, many days in vocals, and many many many days in the video. also learning new video techniques here as always. So at this point it's pretty much understood that my dreams are never going to come true with regard to the pace of music video releases. even at this stage i am frequently racing the clock, setting timers to push speed faster, and the total time for the project still remains many weeks long. the next one i completed in 8 weeks, which was a slight improvement, and the next one also in 8 weeks. then, this puts us at about September, 2018, suddenly i had another one of those panic lightning bolt moments of life-or-death determination. and i decide i'm gonna get this in 2 weeks or die trying. i don't know why this worked this time when i was so far off before, but it worked. many many things about the process changed. the writing changed, the arranging process changed, the vocal session changed drastically (for the better, in multiple ways) and the video session changed drastically. other changes too, in general, such as regimened morning walks to help kick off absolute peak productivity, which also serves as an escape moment to calm down because there is litterally no other time available on this time frame. so for some reason, i was magically able to sustain this 2-week stunt for 7 songs (with video included) in a row. it really seems like the best thing that's ever happened to me, it is reassuring, strengthening, revitalizing, ridiculously exciting, so good in so many ways. also completely and totally terrifying. the last 2 of those songs had their visual component nearly entirely made during the last 36 consecutive hours before release. in the christmas song, i recall screaming and having a total mental breakdown at 5pm on tuesday because i realized the 1st chorus sucks (visually) and i couldn't find a way to make it good. Anyway, something was starting to hit me, and it was the feeling that i need to integrate non-song videos into the schedule. but, being that the 2-week song release schedule was the best thing to ever happen to me, i was not going to give that up. so at this point (early december) i decided i should ADD another video (non-song) to the 2 week schedule, on the opposite week. so the 2 week song schedule would uninterrupted, but i would do a non-song additionally, in between. so essentially that means 1 video every week. If we stop and think about this, we can see that this is sheer greed right here, because about a year earlier, my 'dream schedule' was 2-weeks for a songvideo, and 2 weeks for a non-song, which back then was possible for non-songs but still wildly unattainable for songvideos. and NOW IT'S POSSIBLE as i proved 7 times in a row last fall. So essentially i am strong enough right now to actually do the dream schedule that was so sought after and unattainable last year. but instead, no, i insist on doubling it. here we see the greediness. december 2018, i failed at this, i attempted to do 'ball and stick' for tues dec 4 (the week in between the songs), and just couldn't get it done on time. then i frantically raced to try to still complete a song by the due date (dec 11), but it was chosen too quickly and on friday i noticed some serious problems with the choice, and had to abandon it, with nowhere near enough time to complete an entire song+music video in just 3 days. so in my greed to add non-song content to the 2 week schedule, i failed at the 2 week schedule. and ever since then i have been staggering along, injured and confused. for some reason, i still maintain that what i want is the 1+1 schedule (1 week per video, and alternating songvideo and nonsong). but that is very very very intense. i think the absolute quickest i've ever completed a songvideo might be about 10 days. of course also not helping the situation is the fact that after doing so many 2-week songs, i'm getting thirsty for a little more care and focus and new techniques. so i'm less willing to really make things suck. but for some reason i am still extremely attached to the 1 week schedule even though it is still quite a few steps over my head. oh well, i guess that's <a href=\"alexhonnold-impossiblepossible.mp4\">ambition</a>\n<br><br><h3> \n</h3></quoteaco></quotequestion>",
