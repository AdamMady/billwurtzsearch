Would you mind explaining this form of notation, to a musician-in-training who's used to standard music notation?</qco> </h3>      this person's notation system is very clear to me. they did a good job presenting all the necessary melodic information, specifically the pitch and the rhythm. they are using numbers for scale degrees, so for example in the key of C that would be 1=C, 2=D, etc. They've indicated the rhythm clearly making every note the same length, and using dots do fill equal sized spaces with no notes. The slashes are clearly barlines. thanks to their time-signature hint at the top (3/4) we can assume that each digit or dot represents an eighth note of time. Also very useful is that they are distinguishing notes in different octaves by saying \"lo7\" to represent the 7 below the 1, and so on. So the melody is represented quite clearly and precisely. Information that is NOT included here: chords, tempo, and note duration. However, this particular melody is so strong and familiar the chords are just about totally obvious\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>"
