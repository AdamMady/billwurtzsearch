(actually even the lyrics are about getting away, at that point). and actually, according to the rest of the song, you would expect to pop back to G BEFORE the start of the verse, which is what it does the previous time. but it actually didn't seem to work there, so i ended up staying on Bb for the start of that verse. and then pivoting on 'crazy' back \n<br><br>"
