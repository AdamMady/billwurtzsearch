He often talks about a lot of his greatest hits having lyrics that simply sounded right and have the feeling that the music has, rather than having lyrics that have been agonized over for a long time, like Mrs. Robinson. Something I hear him say a lot is \"I don't really know what that meant when I wrote it, but later I realized...\" Is that in any way your process of writing lyrics, that the goal is that they sound like the music? Or do you craft them to both sound right for the music and mean something intentional and consciously thought of?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
