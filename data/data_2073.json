(I have a pretty decent keyboard and these parts actually sound not too fake). I'd love to one day actually get to play with some horn players or string players. But it's weird writing for instruments you don't play, because I don't know if these parts are playable. I try to stay in their range but there's a whole lot i don't know about the mechanics of these instruments. Like i don't know how long of a phrase a horn/wind player can realistically play without needing space for breathing in between notes/phrases. How fast certain instruments can play or how long they can hold out notes, can this instrument slide up/down to notes and play in between pitches or is it set pitches, stuff like that. I'm worried that I'll spend all this time writing and finally meet musicians to play these parts and they'll be like \"dude, that's not possible t\n o play o\n n this instrument\". I've been on the flip side of this where a piano player has tried to write guitar parts for me, but some of the chord voicings weren't physically possible to play on a guitar.
