Because we are a small spark of self-consciousness in what appears to be a never-ending expanse of lifelessness. There is all of this stuff here, but it's so far apart in all of this nothingness. It doesn't matter, because we are so small, and yet it's the only thing that matters because we the planets are all that really exist. Going around stars that give us heat and energy and life and brought us into this world and keep us safe in their gravity wells. This solar system is our playground and we're both spoiling and squandering it. So many beautiful worlds that we could get to know. The things we aren't doing could save us from our eventual demise, and the things that we are doing are speeding it up. We are trapped on this planet by our own ineptitude and our own inability to just be cool to one another and try to think ab\n out how \n cool the universe is. That's why I like you. You make music that's chill and gets people thinking about how cool shit is. I want to help make more people think about the universe before it's too late because they've just been thinking about themselves. I feel lost and confused and don't know how to start. I tried some stuff but it just got me in trouble and I lost my job because apparently music isn't professional and shouldn't be shared over work email. A lot of other shit happened too. Now I'm broken and tired and just want to run away to the wilderness but it doesn't exist anymore, especially not in the polluted and soon-to-be-underwater concrete hellscape that is Florida. I'm lost and confused and finding hope in your music even though I hate what trying to follow in your footsteps has done to my life. I just wanna run away from the bad. I just wanna run towards the good. I just wanna run. And yet all I can seem to do is cry for the mistakes we as a living planet have ma\n de and t\n he things we have done to ourself. I love this universe. I hate this universe. It's fascinating and brilliant. It's horrible and cruel. It has so much potential and so much risk. I just want to help it.
