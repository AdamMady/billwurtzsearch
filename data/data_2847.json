Some psychologists think if the right brain is quieted too much (too much focus on words, facts etc.) things get gray and we get stuck and unhappy because nothing has meaning. Maybe part of living a meaningful life is focusing on symbolism and beauty the same that we focus on facts, and maybe that means listening to the right brain more, based on modern neuroscience stuff.
