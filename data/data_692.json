I'm sure a great deal of people don't know about modes, or at least not all of them (I certainly don't). But my question is, does every melody fit into some sort of mode?</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like, someone who doesn't know modes could write something in C major that's mostly diatonic, but with a #F and then technically it's lydian. Does every melody fit diatonically to a mode? </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kind of hope not because that feels very restricting (I like a good chromatic melody) but I thought I'd ask my go-to 24/7 music tutor. Anyways, have a good day.</qco> </h3>"
