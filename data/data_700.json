A song's best friend is something that's not a song, and vice versa<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; being in control of the order o\n f recommended listening, being able to do lots of interesting twists and turns by simply i dont know putting in some interlude tracks or whatever _you_ are going to invent at that road, and therefore a longer greater narrative outside the singular ones could turn into something deeper emotionally, with more investment.</qco></h3>      then please, please, (i would argue), make it more than just songs. i think this plays directly into the 'more' theme you are going for here, and i'm wondering why, in such a 'more' theme, you'd want to restrict it something so narrow as just a series of audio tracks<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the songs that can still be experienced as single pieces which are strong enough for them to be considered \"good\", could also have a double triple however many as you much meaning at the whole picture, and n many songs could still be themselves in their own way? one doesn't even need to publish them one at a time, simply just planning the whole process at the writing is enough to make it so, i guess, and they could come as singles, when finished also as a whole with the extra album touches if necessary. and as far as i understood you have no problems in the writing departmant which comes like a natural language to you. this would only differentiate the process of writ\n ing, the amount of production that will be needed to put in would not rise, since there are still n many of songs which is lesser than the amount that you are already going to make? maybe i'm a sucker for continuity and your work and just want to listen to an album that has been made from you, i don't know. but you also don't seem like being a person who willingly refuses having more meaning, especially when the work going to be done is not exponentially increasing, which it doesn't seem like at this case. am i missing something? </qco></h3>      i think so. i think you are putting me on the wrong side of the argument. i am arguing for something 'more' meaningful than an album, not less. in my opinion, at the length of an album, there's much stronger ways to use the same amount of time, in terms of creative audio/visual content. in my opinion<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i would love to hear your reasoning behind not wanting to make albums in more depth, but for me it feels like those pictures made from other pictures square by square, it doesn't have to be like a jigsaw puzzle, pieces don't need to feel empty at any time, but still, you can have n beautiful pictures and a bigger greater +1, as a bonus, with nothing to lose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</qco></h3>      for me personally, the downside to an album is the icky feeling it gives me when listening to it, and the inevitable fruitless search for 'which of these songs i like', (which bizarely always seems to be almost none). And yet, contrarily, any one of those songs can readily become a full blown anthem of life, when found/presented in a more specialized context: such as in a motion picture, or other significant life event<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thank you for all the inspiration and constant reminders of me having free will, it\n  seems like i really do need that sometimes, and your work always finds a subtle way to ring that bell. sorry for the wall of text.</qco> </h3>      \n\n<br><br>"

Find the feature of your computer that actually makes a video file, in 1 file, such as mp4, that you can play in a video player. Everything else is just working backwards from there, figuring out how to change what video it is. Expand the possibilities 1 step at a time. If your video file starts entirely black, the next thing i can suggest is try to make part of it white. If the whole thing is silent, the next step will be to try to make at least some of it non-silent. and take a picture of yourself doing it so you can remember how simplicity works, in case you find yourself in a complicated emergency later on down the road\n<br><br>"
