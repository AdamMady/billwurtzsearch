I think that throughout my career as a musician I have contracted a virus that I can only identify as \"bridge section fanatic syndrome\" or something. It happens even with the classics, to me. Name an artist, I will likely be a fan of their bridges or \"c sections\" alone, even with their most classic songs. It happens with music from all eras (although lately I'm finding a lack in true bridge sections as an entity, if you will, specially in hip hop and trap, even though I enjoy a lot of the music). Those sections are NOTHING without the context of the song but somehow I find myself listening to the entire thing just to get there and enjoy them, justified in my enjoyment for having given that section it's moment to shine (not isolated) but preferring it to the rest of the track nonetheless. It's really weird and it just hit me, thinking about it. I find myself writing songs and instrumentals as strong as I \n can with\n  the purpose of having the thrill of creating a bridge that I love, just for that piece of music. Does anything like this happen to you?</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n Thanks for reading this convoluted text, I'm in the middle of&nbsp;&nbsp;a tornado of self discovery.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
