But whether we're happy or sad, home is home. Now, if our next chord is what we expect it to be, using a lot of the same notes as the first chord, then that's not much of an adventure. but if all of the sudden we're playing very unexpected notes, that can have this otherworldly vibe. i discovered this by playing a D minor chord followed by a B major. because I've already played the D and the F without making it sharp or flat, you really wouldnt expect me to flip it on it's head and make both the D and the F sharp. so it feels like we've learned something new and extraordinary, especially because the B is Major compared to the unhappy minorness of home. a\n m i gett\n ing somewhere?</qco> </h3><br><br>"
