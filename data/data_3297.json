Kind of like, the things you make are your attempt at making better and better mirrors so you can more clearly see the mental-image of \"the thing you want to make\". And through that process you consistently refine your style/personal taste of creativity. But through your refining process over time, it's still in the service of working toward refining that singular style. That's what it seems like to me, and if that isn't the case then my question might not be relatable to you, or my question might be too presumptuous.. \n anyway! \n My question is: do you ever get distracted by wanting to create something else (and how do you deal with that) OR do you try to incorporate that into refining the projects within the style you are already working on? Thanks and I hope you understand my question.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
