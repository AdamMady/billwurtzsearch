The whole \"collab\" thing has become very fake, like 2 people pretending to be friends, who really don't know each other at all, doing a video together only because their managers or promoters or whoever arranged it for them. Then they'll beat the dead horse of doing some kind of 'challenge vid' or some other over-done concept just for the sake of advertising eachother's channels to the other person's fan base... I'm not saying I think you should feel pressured or obligated to collaborate with other people or anything like that, but maybe it's kind of an over-generalizatio\n n to say\n  that other people are only interested in working with you for publicity's sake? </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like, man, if I lived in NY I'd be emailing you all the time to try to convince you to get together and jam with me hahaha...

I don't really understand what you mean when you say things like \"i sort of had an infinite world of musical and artistic vision going on, which no one else seemed to relate to. it seems there were infinite things i wanted to figure out and create. and i was always extremely disappointed that no one seemed capable or willing to go on this journey with me\"... Maybe that was the case when you were younger, or maybe even with people you've met or talked to face to face... But, you have so many huge fans (like millions of people probably) of the stuff you make, and judging by this question page, so many artists/musicians/writers who view you as a major influence and inspiration (myself included). So, I am confused why you think that people don't relate to what you're doing, or that people wouldn't love to go on your journey with you.&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
