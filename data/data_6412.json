I write it all and make demos of the tracks at my house, so I have always had pretty much full creative control. We have decided to record a four song release, but the songs don't sound nearly as good as the demos. I think this is because I have not been able to do everything myself and other people have influenced the sound. I am reluctant to release the songs, even though we have spent money on them and also spent a lot of time on them. I don't want to release something I'm not 100% confident about. What do I do?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
