Like sometimes if I'm in C and I might play an E7 or an A7 (instead of Em or Am), but if I couldn't just do that on the fly with a band right? Like if I play an E7, but the guitarists plays Em that wouldn't really work. Or (still in C) I do a C#7 instead of the G7, but the guitar player does G7 that would clash... I know bands can improvise and stuff, but do the exact chord voicings pretty much need to be worked out beforehand? I've been playing music a long time, but I'm so used to just playing by myself and playing with other people is so new to me, it feels like I'm starting back at square 1?&nbsp;</qco> </h3><br><br>"
