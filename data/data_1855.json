I see how your approach manifests itself in your work (to tasty effect). But the way my own creativity is wired, writing lyrics and music at the same time would be like writing ambidextrously in two different languages at once. For a long time, as a songwriter/composer/alien/etc I saw my lyrics as simply a vessel for the vocal melody, and resented the the listeners' inevitable search Deeper Meaning where there wasn't any. I've ultimately decided that's a cowardly way to go about things, so now I'm stuck. Meaningful words don't come to me through the ether in the same way that music does. \n<br></qco> </h3>      sounds like you need some practice with words ...... try this, open up a text file and go absolutely insane. keep doing it and don't stop ........\n<br><br>"
