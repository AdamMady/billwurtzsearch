At the start of this year I travelled overseas for the first time and was lying on the terminal floor with my travel buddy waiting for the flight out. I was absolutely crapping myself with anxiety coz when I was a kid I witnessed a fatal plane accident and I'd never been over water in a plane and was overthinking like crazy. Anyway. I opened up YouTube for the first time in ages to try to find something to distract myself and at the top was Airport Terminal. I thought \"oh wow that's a cool coincidence\" and I watched it and it calmed me right down because it made the whole experience seem like a cool adventure. Thanks very much for unknowingly helping me.
