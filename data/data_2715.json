I don't know what the heck a 'record town' is or why I sang it at the time, but it really fits so well rhythmically/melodically and for some reason (though I can't pin it down) it even fits the feeling I'm trying to express in the song. I've tried playing with the words, maybe changing 'record' to wrecked up' or something... but \"record town\" just hits right and I feel like I need to keep it.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
