i can't believe myself. well. at least i know now. \n<br>\n<br>rumor has it that i'm a rotten person and everyone knows it. \n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hmm. that's quite a jump. well it's not if you show the thread of thought that connected those things. which i forgot to do because i was busy thinking. or i was thinking about that before. or the parts that would make that make sense somehow fell through the filter. i don't know. i don't know i don't know asdfasdf dfjkdfjkdjfkdfj there's been no editing of this. it's beginning to end. it's not . that. bad. i.dont.know.anymore.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>why?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do  i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>focus. fucking focus fucking focus. what is your point?

yes. i guess.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;okay. what is the difference between a time you did it 'right' and a time you did it 'wrong'?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i forgot to have a point. i just talked to talked. i had feelings, sure, but being caught up in OMFG THIS HAS TO GET DONE AND IT HAS TO GET DONE RIGHT ruins it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>you know what a big part of this is? this is how they teach you to write in school, conveying information in the standard, structured way.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it can work if you're trying to convey plain information, and maybe you can learn to do it up all nice so it's not Boring As Fuck, but when you're writing what's on your mind the points are what's on your mind. and editing what's on your mind is editing out the actual meaning of those thoughts and feelings. \n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how did that not occur to me?\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>okay. i think i'm getting somewhere. i think. but what else?
