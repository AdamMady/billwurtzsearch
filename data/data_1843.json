But all the people I look up to are artists and I want to be like them. So then I don't want to do it. But I try to pressure myself to do it and here's why. Im in high school and I don't want to go to college because school has depressed me and made me go insane and I feel like I have to prove to my parents that I have a special skill or something so that they'd be okay with me not going to college. Because I see you- and it looks to me that you've had your awesome music skills since you were like a kid (I know I could be wrong just correct me or something) and you seem to be pretty successful for not going to college.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So then I think I have to do the same thing. </qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a whole bunch of other people I look up to have also developed their awesome passions at a young age and I feel like I have to do the same. So I'm stuck between this thing of wanting to do artistic stuff right now to help prepare me for the future (even though I don't want to do it at the moment) and doing the things that make me happy even though they're kind of pointless like reading books or playing video games or watching movies. But to be honest, my interests shift by the second. I play video games for a little bit, and then I want to write. So... I have plenty of interests really. They just shift throughout the moment. And here's what I'm thinking: I think I should do the stuff I want to do right now and be concious of what my wants are.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep shuffling around them accordingly to suit what I want at the moment and just kind of look at my wants and see what happens over time.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But be concious of how I'm feeling. Sometimes I think I'll want to do art stuff but other times, I won't want to. But the reason why I'm doing this is to help myself just be myself in the best way. Sometimes I'll do stuff I don't want to do and force myself \n to do it. So I want to keep myself in check. And ask myself, \"do I really want to do this right now?\" and act accordingly instead of just kind of neglecting what I actually do want.</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And over the course of this I'll get to know myself better while freely being myself. For whatever reason, I think this'll be fun.\n</qco></h3><h3> <qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry if this was a bit confusing. I'm just trying to organize myself a bit and typing to you helps me get better at this stuff for some reason. So I'll see you man. I think I'll let you know how it goes.&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"

I haven't been diagnosed for any mental disorders but lately I've just been constantly thinking about the fact that I've just moved schools in term 2 of grade 11 and I'm not close to my tiny class of like 10 people and I don't really relate to them as friends. I have an extremely tight group of friends outside of school but I only get to see some on the weekend sometimes. Mum doesn't let me go out of my suburb to see them though that often and most of the time I just have to stay home and talk to them over the phone or text or something. I'm a really introverted person except around my close friends where I really thrive. Around them is the only times I actually feel happy and feel like living. But I only get to feel that way a few days in a month. Every other day is literal hell. I sit in the corner by myself at school listening to music and trudging through ATAR hell and I s\n pend lun\n ch breaks sitting in the corner of the common room buried in beanbags. And I just feel like crying all the time those days and I feel like it's just not worth living at all and I'm so empty and sad. I'm too scared to talk to professional counselors or even like those crisis support hotlines and even my own parents and siblings?? I only talk to that group of friends about how I'm feeling but they can't really help all that much apart from just talking to me where it does improve my mood a little. I find you a really good guy to just vent to as well and I'm sorry to force you to read my sad wall of text but yeah idk what to do and I'm just stuck...\n<br></qco> </h3>"
