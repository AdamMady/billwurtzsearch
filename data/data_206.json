Also, sorry if I ask too much and feel free to omit [not answer everything].  Relatively recently, I got more curious than I've ever been about music. And I found on the internet that you're self-taught and (from what I understand) that you don't really like music theory, and say that music can't really be described like that [sorry if I oversimplfy or misunderstand some stuff]. Which sounds kinda like the approach I would want to take to understand music better and/or maybe even write some of my own music later on.  I think what sparkled my curiosity in music, was that some particular songs made me feel specific feelings, some songs being especially intense in that (a large amount of feeling ignited) [How did you get into music? (curiosity)].</qco></h3>"
