Like I could look at an elephant's tail through a tube and describe what I saw and someone else could look at the same elephant but be looking at the ear and describe the elephant totally differently. And so then I feel badly for even talking about what I see because I know I can't see the whole picture, but I also can only describe what I can see. And so I feel like a liar no matter how truthful I try to be. And so then I don't want to say anything. But I'm also just so infinitely curious about the elephant and the only way any of us are gonna piece it together is by sharing the parts we can see and believing in each other. But it's so hard sometimes. </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does running this questions page give you a sense of centeredness when you realize everyone is as adrift as everyone else?
