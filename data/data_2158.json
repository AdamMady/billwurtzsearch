After the big bang, there's pretty much a straightforward story line for you to follow (if you can call the history of the world straightforward)... but everything from \"hi, you're on a rock...\" up until \"i think there's a universe now\" must've been really tricky to write. The origin of the universe (and history of the universe) seems like a real tough story to set the scene for. Did you find it hard to come up with a good intro for the video?
