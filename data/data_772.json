One of the coolest things about our universe is the way things can change<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I just don't know what??? I consume and consume all the sights and events and media around me and I have all of these thoughts and desire to do SOMETHING</qco></h3>      yes, this is good. you are getting charged up. You will probably experience some high passions and maybe a lot of envy and jealous rage, at this time. jealous of the people whose content you are consuming, because you really would like to be the one creating the content. At least that has been my experience<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but I can't figure out what to channel it into. Once I figure out what I should be doing I know I'll put my blood, sweat, and tears into it but I just can't find a starting point. I'm also at the age where I need to start planning what to do with my life</qco></h3>      that's every age<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and how to make money and shit but\n  I just \n disappoint everyone who wants things from me because I can't stay motivated because I just don't have a PURPOSE. I just wish I had something I could be proud of and that I could be respected or respect myself for, something I poured all this energy I have inside me into, something that I can die with satisfaction knowing that I did. </qco></h3>      with the amount of passion you have already demonstrated, you are going to find this in copious quantities, throughout your life. When in this moment it may seem like these 'purposes' are in 0 places, pretty soon you will find them in infinite places. infinity has a weird tendency to look like 0 sometimes. i think the first step is to be aware of this fact (at least it was for me). which is to realize that massive possibilities and potential exists literally everywhere, in everything. For me, i've dedicated my life to proving this, but before i felt like i had done it, i was always searching for any time i felt like someone else had proved it, and latch onto that and study it and use it as proof that it can be done.<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't even know what kind of advice you could give me lol, but honestly if you have any thoughts or anything at all it would be really cool :)</qco> </h3>      \nI feel i should probably stop telling everyone to \"write\" a lot, because maybe some people just don't enjoy witing. But .... for you, it seems like you are perfectly comfartable writing, as you've just demonstrated. So i think you should find your most comfortable writing tool (a text editor on a computer, wherever you are most comfortable writing/typing), and just start.... USING it. Do anything you can in it. Use it to be honest. Use it to paint pictures. i don't care what you use it for, .... anywhere between honesty and art, fiction to diagrams, .... i mean, just test the keyboard, to start out with. Make sure every key is working. This will be one of the simplest ways to get your brain to start putting things into the world. Basically what we need to do is open up these pathways so your brain can start communicating with the world and putting things out there. you've demonstrated clearly that you are in the sort of 'consuming' stage, with some pent up desire to be the one on the other end of that. Maybe watch some film directors interviews on youtube. That could be a starting place. You might not want to direct films, but it might remind you of something else you do want to do. But another thing i should remind you, finding these things is like a river. You just make your best guess and do a thing, and then along the way you will hear some signals that will give you another hint of what you should try next. Trust me, these rivers ALWAYS get to huge dank oceans, eventually, if you let them flow. And you have made it clear that you have a huge amount of water to start with<br><br>"

I'm seventeen and apparently yesterday I couldn't choose what I'd have for lunch, but today I'm supposed to decide what to do for the rest of my life? </qco></h3>      there's no reason you should have to do that today. You may have known some of it since you were 6, and you may not find some of it until you are 96<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I've had this idea in the back of my mind for years, but I feel like I used to be scared of not knowing what to do and now I'm just kinda scared of knowing I don't want to do anything. Growing up, I've developed real interst in mathematics and languages, and I always thought I'd do something related to one of these areas. But now that I actually have to choose, I don't want either.</qco></h3>      you don't have to choose. those are both cool things, and they are allowed to be in your life, as much or little as you want<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in a developing country and everything is focused in applicability: maths and languages courses are too much about applied knowledge, never seen as pure areas of study. The reason why I fell in love with maths and languages in the first place was by overanalyzing things that have no real impact in the world: I liked that they were beautiful on their own, with no need to ever be used. And the prospects for me are really negative from this point on, because I feel like every college I go to and every job available for me will be quite the opposite of that. I wish I lived in the US or Europe where pure sciences actually exist, but I don't, and I can't afford to go these places. I feel like there's nothing I want to do with the rest of my life, and yet my parents say I have to choose soon because I gotta make money somehow.</qco></h3>      i think you will still get a chance to do many things with your life, besides the things you do for employment. Sure, make some decisions on that now, but just make the best decision you can, based on the information you have. even if if you don't have all the information. Because you are obviously still missing at least half of the information. most people are. but you will find a lot of that information along the way. And either one you choose, you'll probably learn something.  and also keep in mind that some of the most powerful things to be learned, may come from outside the 'curriculum'<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I know this completely out of the scope of this page, I just really needed someone to talk to. I guess my question is \"what should I do given that I'm a broken piece in the machine of human existence and don't seem to have any use to anyone or be able to perform any useful service to humanity, however small?\"</qco> </h3>      just taking a quick glance at the big picture here, just on the page here, it appears you seem to have some writing skills. which i can guarantee is a useful skill, in many many ways, and is still alive and thriving especially now in the internet age\n\n<br><br>"
