But I dont know if it's bothering me because i know i should feel bad about not having an entirely original video aesthetic or if the word just doesnt seem fair to others who are doing their best with tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making the music takes time, making the videos takes time, somehow this way of making videos just feels so intuitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like it's the most effective and efficient way to make content that is of some quality.&nbsp;\n &nbsp;I'm not sure how to feel about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you advise me to steer clear of this way of editing?&nbsp;&nbsp;I get a bit panicky when I think of turning up the different dial because I dont know how to conceptualize another video style that feels like it has quality to it but doesnt take forever to make (using only my simple tools).&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I screwed?&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of me does feel bad because I feel like if I'm good enough I should know what to do about this problem.</qco> </h3><br><br>"
