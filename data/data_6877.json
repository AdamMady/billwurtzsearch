I have a lot of music and artwork that I want to put online (maybe make my own website, but I gotta figure out how to do that)... but I'm kind of torn because, and again maybe I'm being childish, but I'm afraid to share it because I'm afraid of being ridiculed. There's a lot of heavy, deeply personal stuff that comes out in my lyrics and my drawings that I have never expressed or shared with the people I know. And if any of them see it, it would be dropping a huge bombshell on them, changing their perceptions of me. I'm not really afraid of people not liking it, moreso just people thinking 'what the fuck, man'... I have no problems sharing the stuff I make with complete strangers.. but the thought of having friends or family see it is just downright terrifying for me (nobody even knows that I draw or write lyrics/sing... I only share instrumental stuff with friends)...
