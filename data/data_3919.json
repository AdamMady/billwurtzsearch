Button components have 2 visible elements to it, the outer bounding box, and the text inside it. In typical usage, a mouse click within the bounding box triggers the action of the button. The click action can be associated with the inclosed text, the bounding box, or both. If the text has no clickable action, it seems reasonable that \"missing value\" would be returned, even if it is able to find the text itself. Automator may have incorrectly assumed the click action was associated with the text instead of the bounding box, or if your program is particularly nasty, the click action may be just associated with a certain x y position on the screen. Somehow you have to get the name of the actual button box,\t\t and script a click action on that box rather than the text.</qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is possible to script a click action to a x y positio\n n, you c\n an hopefully skip this mess, </qco></h3><h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\talthough as you mentioned previously you would need to watch window size/position or create different scripts for different work environments.
