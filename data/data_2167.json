So if the fast part is going faster than the slow part, then why isn't there a gap in between the fast and slow parts where there isn't any water?\" and I knew how rivers worked so I told him \"the size of the river changes\" and he was like \"yes! That's how good time works! it can speed up or slow down, but there is always the same amount of 'water', and when people aren't very good at keeping time, there are these wedges in the river where there is empty space.\" I love this analogy but I still don't fully understand the \"water\" part in terms of music.

Move that up a few octaves (22) and you pretty much got a G note. Using the same math... I found that Mercury and Venus are both closest to A. Earth and Mars are closest to G. Jupiter is closest to Bb. Saturn is closest to A. Uranus is closest to C#. Neptune is closest to D. So our solar system is playing, like a Gm9#11 chord? Why such a sad, weird, dissonant chord do you think? Why does our solar system feel like that? Pluto would be closest to B... which would make the chord even weirder.... I don't even know what you'd name that chord. Maybe this is why scientists don't want to make pluto a planet???&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"

I've had asthma since I was a kid, and other recurring respiratory issues.. so sometimes it's tough to hold out a note for a long time, or to sing a full phrase without having to stop to take a breath, I think it might limit my vocal range too. When I do try and sing, I sound like if&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald Fagen smoked way too many cigarettes and put a clothespin on his nose. I love music, and I like to think that I am pretty decent on the instruments I play, but so many songs are driven by the vocal parts. Like, I think really the function of instruments in a song is to compliment/accompany the vocals (which should usually be front and center)... Not really singing makes it tough for me to actually come up with vocal parts, so I try to over-compensate with the instruments when I write. But when I do play with a singer, usually there's too much going on with the in\nstrument\nal arrangements and it sounds too jumbled/cluttered. Any advice for me?&nbsp;</qco> </h3>"
